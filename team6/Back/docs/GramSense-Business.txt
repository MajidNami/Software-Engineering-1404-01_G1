1. user sees a "send sentence for grammar evaluation" box. user sends sentence. backend uses external AI to evaluate user sentence. backend will tag the error (using grammar topic enum which is sent to AI), and reads 1 medium level examples and 1 medium level exercises from db. backend will put all this (grammar topic, correction, exercises and examples) into an object and send it back to front. if no correction is made to user sentence, only grammar topic is sent back.
2. user enters profile page and sees window for exercise. user can choose grammar topic and difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) and send to backend. backend retrieves 2 fresh exercises (there needs to be a functionality to now show already requested exercises to each user) from db and send it back to front.
3. user can see a similar window for examples. they also require grammar topic and difficulty level. backend retrieves 2 fresh examples and send it back to front.
4. user enters profile page and see a window for stats. the stats are chosen per grammar topic and difficulty. the stats contain data for total num of sentences sent for eval, total num of successful eval (no correction), total num of seen examples, total num of exercises and total num of successful exercises.
5. user solves exercises by dragging text objects according to exercise type and front sends full answer to backend. backend validates answer and sends result.
