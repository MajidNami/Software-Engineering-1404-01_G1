# AUXILIARY TEMPLATES

We initially had another Figma project, but due to recent internet problems and disruptions in Iran, we were forced to design a new UI in Figma.
The new UI was used throughout the project. However, the previous UI was still programmed, with the group's opinion, as an additional feature (giving the user the right to choose the UI) to further interact with the project.
