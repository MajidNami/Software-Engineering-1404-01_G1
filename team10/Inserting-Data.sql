There is a famous tourist park in Cavita. It is known for its cool weather and nice view of a volcano. We go there when there''s a special occasion, like birthdays or holidays. What about you?

In March, children go back to school. In April, they celebrate Easter with some really delicious special breads.

I love multitasking. Meg: Sounds like you''re good at multitasking. Todd: Let''s talk about outdoor activities. Do you like doing yard work? Meg: I don''t especially like doing yard work. But right now, I don''t have a yard. So, doing yard work isn''t something I have to worry about. What about you? Todd: I like doing yard work. I think it''s very relaxing. It''s like cleaning. So, I enjoy it. But like you, I don''t have a yard. So, now I don''t do yard work very much. Or I can''t do yard work. Meg: So, you like gardening if you have a yard? Todd: Yeah. I grew up on a big house. So, we have lots of yard work, lots of gardening. So, yeah. Meg: Right. Todd: But what about other things like hiking, do you like hiking? Meg: I love hiking. Anything that is in nature, I love doing. I love hiking. I love kayaking. I love canoing. Any outdoor sports. Do you like hiking? Todd: I do. I''m with you. I love hiking. What about things like rock climbing? Meg: I have never been rock climbing. Have you gone rock climbing? Todd: No. Rock climbing looks dangerous. So, I''m still scared. Meg: Yeah, Todd: So, I''ve never done rock climbing either. What about things like singing and dancing? Do you enjoy singing and dancing? Meg: I enjoy singing, but I''m not very good at it. So, I like singing when I''m alone or in my car. Are you good at singing? Todd: No, I''m terrible at singing. So, I hate singing. I really, really hate singing. But I like going to karaoke and listening to people sing. Meg: Yeah, some people are really good at singing. What about dancing? Todd: I hate dancing too. Yeah, I''m not good at dancing. So, dancing is very embarrassing for me. I don''t like it. Meg: I''m not good at dancing either. Todd: Are there any other activities you really dislike doing? Like for me, I hate writing letters. For example, I don''t like writing thank you letters. I don''t like writing anything with my hand. Typing is okay. I don''t mind typing things, but I hate writing. Meg: So, using your hand to write, you hate writing? Todd: Yeah, I like typing. Fingers is okay. Thumb is okay on the phone. I don''t mind texting, I don''t mind typing. I just don''t like physically writing with a pencil or a pen. Meg: Yeah. Pen or a pencil, like writing a letter. Todd: Right. Because my writing is really bad, and it''s hard to read. So, it''s embarrassing. Meg: I''m sure it''s fine. Todd: Yeah. How about you? For example, do you like iron in your clothes? Meg: I don''t like having my clothes, but my clothes usually don''t need ironing, so I don''t have to worry about it too much. I don''t like doing laundry. It''s related to ironing clothes. So, it takes a long time. And the clothes, I have to dry the clothes. So, doing laundry is a little bit boring for me. Todd: I don''t mind doing laundry if I go to the coin laundry, but I hate hanging my laundry out. I hate hanging out my laundry. It takes forever. I don''t know why, you put it out, you take it back in, it just takes so much time. Meg: That''s funny. I''m kind of the opposite. I don''t mind hanging out my laundry, because I like saving money, so I don''t have to use money at the coin laundry. Todd: Plus, you are helping the environment. Meg: That''s true. I like helping the earth. Todd: Yeah, I should change. Okay. Thanks Meg.

Meg: Okay. Todd: It''s a personality test. Meg: Uh-oh. Todd: And we want to know, are you a pack rat? Meg: Am I a pack rat? Todd: Right. Do you save things, do you keep things, or are you a minimalist? Do you have very few things in your house? Meg: Well, I think I try to be a minimalist, but I''m a little bit of a pack rat. Todd: Okay. We''ll take the test, let''s see. Okay, the first question is, how many books do you have in your house? Meg: Not counting Kindle? Todd: Not counting Kindle. Physical books, how many books do you have? Meg: Physical books, I think I have around 15 books. Todd: Oh. Oh. Meg: Is that a lot? Todd: That''s bad. Meg: That''s so many? Todd: Yeah. Meg: Really? Todd: So negative- Meg: Uh-oh. Todd: Negative ... Boo. Negative one means pack rat [crosstalk 00:00:58] positive one means minimalist. Okay. Next question. How many shoes do you have? Meg: Can I not answer that question? Todd: No. You have to say. Meg: Okay. I think I have 25 pairs of shoes. Todd: Oh my gosh. I''m giving you negative two points. Meg: No, just one. Todd: All right. Next question is, how many blankets do you have? Meg: Blankets? I think I have 10 blankets. Todd: Oh my gosh. I knew you were a pack rat. I knew it, I knew it. Now you''re negative five. Meg: But you need blankets for the cold winter. Todd: You only need one blanket. Meg: But if you have friends visiting you, you need more blankets. Todd: Okay. Meg: I have a lot of friends. Todd: Wow. That''s a good point. Okay, next question. How many umbrellas do you have? Meg: I think I have around five or six umbrellas. Todd: Wow. And you live alone, correct? Meg: Yes. I live alone. Todd: Okay. So a pack rat is somebody who does not get rid of things they don''t need. So, do you need five umbrellas? Meg: I do need those umbrellas. Todd: Why do you need ... Meg: I''ll tell you. I''ll tell you why. One is a very small umbrella that''s easy to carry. Another umbrella is very large for a really rainy day. A third umbrella is decorative and very pretty. The fourth umbrella is for the sun. And the fifth umbrella is clear, to use on a really windy day. Todd: That''s interesting. Now, the fourth umbrella, for the sun, that''s called a parasol, correct? Meg: I guess so, but that sounds a little old-fashioned. Todd: Okay. I won''t consider that. I consider an umbrella for the rain only. So, we''ll say four. Meg: Four. Todd: So let''s just ... Meg: Do I get a point back? Todd: You do. But let''s do a recap. You are single, you live alone. Meg: Yes. Todd: You have four umbrellas. Meg: Yes. Todd: You have 10 blankets. Meg: Yes. Todd: You have 25 pairs of shoes. Meg: Correct. Todd: And you have 15 books? Meg: 15 books. Todd: I''m sorry, Meg, but you qualify as a pack rat. Meg: Oh no. Todd: You are not a minimalist. We''re taking away your minimalist membership. Meg: Oh. Well I guess I need to get rid of some things, huh? And what about you? Are you a pack rat or a minimalist? Todd: I''m pretty much a minimalist, I think, because I only have two bags of stuff. Meg: Only two bags? Todd: Yeah. So, you can take everything I have and put it in two big suitcases. Meg: So you don''t have 15 books? Todd: No, I have maybe four books. Meg: Only four books. Todd: And they''re very small paperback books. Meg: What about blankets? Todd: I have one blanket. Meg: Just one. Todd: Just one. Meg: So if visitors come to your house ... Todd: That is true. Meg: ... they''re out of luck. Todd: When somebody comes to my house, I ask my neighbor to borrow a blanket. I do. Why? Meg: You borrow a blanket? Todd: ... is that funny? Yes. This is- Meg: Wow. Todd: I am such a minimalist, my friend told me, he said I am the only person that has ... Meg: One blanket. Todd: No. A spoon and a fork. Meg: A spoon and a fork? Todd: That''s it. I have one. Meg: Okay. So basically, your house is not prepared for any visitors. Todd: That''s true. Meg: Whereas my house is prepared for many visitors. Todd: That''s true. Meg: Okay. Umbrellas? Todd: I have maybe two. Meg: Two. So why two? Todd: Because I can''t remember if I have one or I will leave the house and I won''t take it, and so then I need to buy one and then... Meg: And then you get rid of one? Todd: No, then I just never buy another one. I''m pretty good. Meg: Oh. Todd: Only two. Meg: Okay. Todd: But shoes? Meg: Shoes. Todd: I only have four pairs of shoes. Meg: What is the purpose of each pair of shoes? Todd: I have one pair of shoes for work. Nice dress shoes. I have two sneakers, one pair of sneakers for running, jogging, one pair of sneakers for fashion, and one pair of Futsal shoes for soccer. That''s it. That''s it. Meg: Wow.

But because my time was so short, I could only spend one or two days in each city. Todd: Ah! What city did you like the most? Abidemi: I think I prefer Hanoi the most. The food, the street food is amazing. It’s a very lively city, lots of motorcycles and traffic so it reminded me of Nigeria where I was born a little bit. Todd: Oh cool! Abidemi: Yes. Todd: And what did you do in Vietnam? Abidemi: I spent time in Hanoi. I also went to visit Sapa, which has a lot of rice terraces. So these are mountains where they’ve planted rice fields. So the scenery, the view is really beautiful. And you also get to meet the native people, the local people there. So I enjoyed it. And then from there I went to Hoi An, which is a very historical city, very beautiful night scenery by the river. And then I went to Ho Chi Minh City but I could only spend one night there before leaving for Myanmar. Todd: OK. And then, how was Myanmar? What did you do there? Abidemi: Myanmar was my last stop. And I didn’t have so much time there but I managed to go—but I managed to visit some of the places I really wanted to see like Yangon, Bagan, and Mandalay. I would say that Bagan was the highlight. They had many temples from the past and just seeing that many of them, it was very impressive. Todd: That’s fantastic. Abidemi: Yes. Todd: So what country was your favorite?

It''s a little bit impolite. What about looking at other people''s monitor over their shoulder? ''Cause you just mentioned the BTS. One thing I have to admit is, because I don''t have my phone out and I am looking around, I have a tendency to see, wanna check and see what''s on everybody''s phone. And it''s total intrusion. It''s creepy in a way, but it''s also because in Asia I''m a little bit taller than the average person, so I''m looking down and I can see everybody''s monitor. And yeah, do you ever find yourself doing that too? Angela: I do, yeah. But like you, I think it''s impolite. Todd: Right. So you gotta pull away, I know I shouldn''t do it. Angela: But you know the worst thing with phones these days, the worst thing from my point of view is the amount of pictures that people take of themselves everywhere, on the BTS, on the subway, eating. I''ve been to S21 in Cambodia where those poor people were slaughtered basically, and there are people in front of pictures of these people who were killed, and they are just literally taking selfies of themselves, you know, this world isn''t about you. It''s sometimes, just stop and look and listen. Todd: Yeah, the selfie thing, I did a little bit. Sometimes I would do it almost like it''s sending a postcard. Angela: Yeah Todd: You know what I mean? "Oh, look, I''m here." But I have to admit, yeah, I don''t really like doing it, yeah. Angela: I''m gonna take the shot again, the shot again. I use selfies in a group, because I think they''re fun. It''s actually quite fun to see one person in the front and the rest in the back. Todd: Yes. Angela: And it usually means that I can get further back in the photograph, so that''s always a good thing. Todd: Oh, yeah, that''s true. So but, that''s good that you admit you do some selfies. Angela: Yeah, yeah, yeah, with groups. And if I''m taking a group in the class, I''ll get one of them to take the photograph. Todd: Yeah. What about the ... mild pet peeve of mine, not a pet peeve, but people taking photos of their food. I don''t know why it''s a thing. Angela: Why? Eat it. Todd: Yeah, exactly, enjoy it. Enjoy the memory. It''s interesting that you said that about Cambodia. A woman, a group of women once said something that was really like just a spear in the heart, really made me think. I was in Cambodia, this was years ago, and I was at Angkor, at Baton, Bayon, or I can''t say it right, but where they have the beautiful face sculptures, and I''m like, "Oh, I gotta get a photo." And so there was a woman just sitting there, relaxed, she was maybe French or something, she was European, and she was like, "Oh, you want me to take your photo?" And I go, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." So then she takes it, she takes my photo, this was before cell phone cameras. And then I''m like, okay, I have to reciprocate. I go, "Oh, would you like me to take a photo of you?" She''s like, "No." I''m like, "You don''t have a camera?" And she goes, "No," and she just points at her head and she taps her head like this, and she goes, "It''s all up here." And I was like, "Wow." She was really- Angela: amazing, yeah. Todd: ... kind of like, politely saying, "Just, I''m never gonna ..." I''ve never forgotten how all those things look, I''ve never forgotten her sitting on the rock when she said that. So wise advice I think. Angela: Yeah, I think so. Todd: Now, actually you are in photography. Do you think that actually taking so many ... I''m sorry, you have a photography business. Angela: Yes. Todd: Do you think that actually taking so many photographs lessens the value of the art of photography and really appreciating a good picture? Angela: Yes, I think it does. And I think that a lot of the apps and the things that you can use these days to improve photographs take away the real skill of the photographer, using the light, using the lines, using what''s in the photograph to make a really good shot. I think people miss that these days. Todd: Yeah. That is true. Anyway, so today, no using your phone.

Angela: If they''re on a break, I always call it their text break, because when I''m teaching English out here I find that people have got their phone to their hand, and maybe they''re Googling a word or something, so it''s not too much of a distraction. But when you stop them for a break, as soon as you say "let''s have a break now," they''re all after their phones, and they''re sitting individually looking at their phones. Todd: And it''s silent, I know what you mean. I''ll teach, and it used to be you would say "okay take a break," and it would be really loud, they would start talking with each other. And these days it''s just silence, they just go and they do that motion of just flicking with their finger, as they''re scrolling down. And I know I just sound like some old guy, "hey, get off my lawn!" And I have the same problem, I want to check my phone all the time, but I have to admit it''s strange I think. Angela: And now you needn''t even check your phone, you just look at your Apple watch or your watch on your wrist, it''s going to tell you if your phone needs your attention. Todd: But it used to be where I would say things like, you know as a teacher you''re teaching, you can see if the student''s looking down at their phone, and I would say "hey, don''t check your phone." But now these days kids actually call me on it, they''re like, "Oh, I''m looking up a word," or "Oh, I''m checking something," and they literally are checking something. And the kids are good at using their phone as a learning tool - Angela: Yes, I think that''s fine. Todd: So it is, it''s a gray area these days. Yeah. So when you''re with somebody you never pop out your phone? Angela: I would admit that I will be guilty of checking my phone in my bag, but I would never get it out and go on Facebook or Instagram and start Instagramming, I would just look at it and put it away. Todd: Yeah. There''s other things I''ve done, I mean could be because I''m getting older, but for example I try not to listen to my iPod so much anymore, or my phone. Radio, music, whatever. I actually just try to listen. I notice that when I am always listening to everything I kind of tune the world out, and I might miss things. Angela: You will miss things. You see people, I''ve been quite tempted some days to put my earphones in and walk to the BTS, but actually I think, no, you''d miss the traffic noise, you miss the tuk tuks, you miss a dimension of the world that''s happening around you. And then you get on the BTS and everybody in the carriage is head down, same position, on their phones. Todd: Yeah. And actually I don''t do it just for that reason, because I noticed that I''m missing out. It''s so tempting, but I might see something.', '{"difficulty_code": "B1", "duration_type": "conversations", "source": "downloaded_dataset"}', 'en-US', 'USA, Switzerland', 120, '2024-01-01 00:00:00', '2024-01-01 00:00:00', 1, 1, 0);

And we are going to talk about fashion. So, Jerri, Bangkok is a very, very fashion-conscious city. Jerri: Yes, absolutely. Todd: Shopping is huge here. So, let''s talk about prices. So, first we''ll talk about jeans. You are wearing jeans today. So, how much are an expensive pair of jeans in Bangkok? Jerri: Well, that''s funny that you ask because the price range for clothes here is quite wide, so you can go from 200 baht - Thai baht - for a pair of jeans up to 4000 Thai baht for a pair of jeans in a, like a, like, one of the top brands. Todd: Wow. So, just so people know, 200 baht would be - in U.S. dollar that''s about six dollars. And 4000 baht would be about 130 dollars. Jerri: Yes. Yeah. Todd: Wow. Jerri: So, it''s quite a, quite a difference there. But I would say that generally it will be in the range of 500 to 2000 Thai baht. Todd: Okay. 500 to 2000. That''s still pretty a wide gap. Jerri: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Todd: Okay, cool. So those are jeans. What about, for women, a blouse? Jerri: A blouse? I would say...for, like, a nice quality one, like, 500 Thai baht. Todd: Okay. That''s not bad. Jerri: Yeah. That''s alright. Todd: What''s the most you would pay for a blouse? Jerri: No more than 1000 Thai baht. Todd: Okay. Jerri: Yeah. Todd: That''s your, that''s - what about the cheapest? Jerri: The cheapest? Like, 300 Thai baht. Like, if you started going lower than 300 Thai baht, then you have to accept that the, you know, the quality - you might get to wear it not more than three times. Todd: Okay. Jerri: So, that''s the price you pay. Todd: Nice, alright. So, what about shoes? Jerri: Shoes? It''s - it also depends on where you go. So, Chatuchak market is known for affordable clothes, so the shoes there would be from 200 Thai baht to 500 Thai baht. But if you visit the more well-known stores and the department stores, then they can be from 500 Thai baht to 1000 Thai baht. Todd: Okay, that''s interesting. So, you mentioned Jatujak market - can you kind of talk about Jatujak market? Jerri: Yes, so, this is one of the main activities for tourists to do when they visit Bangkok. It''s a weekend market, so it''s only open on Saturdays and Sundays. It''s quite crowded, but it''s definitely something you should do. There''s a lot of souvenir stores, a lot of local shops, and, yeah, a place to shop for clothes. And it''s not just for tourists, you also see a lot of Thais go there because all the stores there are reasonable - reasonably priced and they''re quite trendy. Yeah, they have, like, different styles...stores that you won''t find anywhere else. Todd: Right. Oh, yeah, I''ve been there a couple of times. It''s massive. It''s really, really big. Jerri: Yeah, it''s massive. It takes about half a day to do the entire thing. Todd: It''s easy to get lost right? Jerri: Yes. Todd: If you go inside, you kind of don''t know where you are. Jerri: Exactly, exactly. Which I guess is also the fun part of it. It''s like an adventure in itself, right? Todd: Right, exactly. Okay, so, what about things like, like belts or, you know, like accessories? Jerri: I would recommend going to Platinum Mall. This mall is located near Siam BTS station. It''s known for its accessories that are, like, reasonably priced. So, at that - at Platinum Mall accessories can be from two - 100 Thai baht to not more than 1000 Thai baht, but usually in the range of 100 to 500 Thai baht. Todd: Okay. Oh, wow. Jerri: Yeah. But there''s a whole floor, like, two floors that''s dedicated to accessories. So, you can find necklaces, sunglasses, rings, earrings, about ten shops for each category, yes. Todd: Oh, that''s fantastic. So, Bangkok''s quite interesting because it has so many different ways. You can buy things on the street... Jerri: Yes. Todd: You can buy things at the markets. You can buy things at the nice, air-conditioned malls. Jerri: Yeah. Todd: Yeah. What about online? Do you Thais shop online very much? Jerri: Yeah. Online - online shops are becoming more and more popular now because it''s quite convenient. You just get it delivered to you. Yeah, there''s a lot of - a lot of more fashion brands that are online. On Instagram, for example. Yeah, so it''s becoming a thing. Todd: Oh, cool. Alright, thanks Jerri.

So these islands in Thailand get a lot of tourists. Jerri: Yes, right. Todd: Thailand probably gets more tourists to its islands than any other country in the world. Is there like any concerns about the environment or development on the islands? Jerri: Yes, of course. Wherever there are people, there’s always an effect on the environment. And you see this a lot, especially on the most visited islands such as Phuket and Samoi with the development of condominiums, schools, malls, leads to deforestation, of course, and more pollution. You also see the effect more on the more vulnerable islands like the smaller islands such as, I think, Koh Phi Phi or Koh Lanta. All of the islands used to be full of trees and it used to be like national parks. And now with the people taking speed boats and everything, you really see the oils on the sea. The coral reefs are not as colorful as they should be. All the plastic that comes with, you know, getting food boxes, plastic straws. Yeah. And you really see the ecosystems in the sea are affected. Todd: Yeah, that’s what I tell – that’s a problem that we have to solve everywhere in the world, it seems like, especially the plastic. Do you know about Easter Island in Chile? You know, with the big stone statues? Jerri: No, not so much. Todd: Yeah, that reminds me of Easter Island which is, you know, famous in Chile for its really large stone monuments like the stone faces. And they couldn’t figure out how the people disappeared or why they disappeared, and now they think it’s because they cut down all the trees. Jerri: Oh, wow. Todd: And after they cut down all the trees, that basically destroyed the environment, and the people couldn’t survive anymore so they had to leave the island. So islands really are vulnerable, especially with their trees, right? Jerri: Right. Yeah, absolutely. Todd: That’s one of the reasons I really like Koh Chang, because you can only develop on one side of the road, you know. Jerri: Yeah. Todd: So there’s a road around the island and if it’s on the beach side you can develop, but anything inland on the other side of the road, there’s pretty much no development. Jerri: Yes. But there are also on the positive side you see, you know, when – there are things like bad things happening to environment, you see innovation, people actually coming up with ideas. So a lot of hotel chains, for example, are becoming more sustainable. They’re incorporating metal straws, paper straws. So you do see some changes but there’s a long way to go. Todd: Yeah, you know, I think that’s a great point. Like eventually, business can find the solution. Jerri: Yeah, yeah. That’s always… Todd: It’s in their best interest, right? Oh, that’s really nice. So what about the economy? I guess the biggest jobs are the resorts? Jerri: Yes. So the Thai economy relies on tourists. Yeah, like the hotels, the restaurants, that’s where we get our money flowing, I would say. Todd: Right. So that’s your [inaudible 0:03:19.4] of the capital influx from other countries. Jerri: Yes. Todd: Right, okay. So, you live in Bangkok. Out of curiosity, how often do you get to a resort or to the beach? Jerri: More than I should, to be honest. Like I love the islands so every opportunity I get, I’ll fly down south, and then visit the different ones. But yeah, as I mentioned, my favorite one would be Koh Pangan. Yeah. Todd: Can you fly directly from Bangkok to Koh Pangan? Jerri: Yes. Well, not directly, but you can fly to the mainland which is Surat Thani. And it’s actually nice just to spend a day there because Surat Thani, there’s like a culture there and then you get to try the authentic Southern food before you actually go to the islands and it becomes a little bit more like Western, with the taste and everything. So that’s my recommendation. And then the next day, you can just go to the pier and take a ferry to the different islands you want to go to. Todd: Oh, wow. So I definitely, definitely want to take your advice. Jerri: Thank you.

I think that''s really, really motivative to student''s to study hard because everybody do the same and they are trying their best to be the best. Todd: Wow. Yeah we have a phrase in English like, "A rising tide lifts all boats", and I think it''s kind of the same. So if it''s really rigorous for most people, it''s gonna pull everybody up. Rufei: Yes.

Todd: Okay. There''s nothing you would change? Like if you were in charge would you give maybe a little more vacation time? Would you start the day later? Would you make classes smaller? Rufei: If I can choose I will definitely don''t choose my school because that was horrible for me because I need a lot of sleep than normal people, but I cannot have that much time to sleep. So I always sleep on the class, and when somebody found out that I am sleeping on the class they will decrease the score of my class. Todd: Oh, that''s serious. Rufei: Yes, very serious. Yeah, your teacher would punish you to write a paper like, "I am sorry I decreased the score of our class, I shouldn''t sleep on the class", and I have to write it for like an hour to write that stuff. Todd: That is very harsh. Rufei: Yeah. Todd: I think though a lot of people, when they hear stories like that they actually are a little bit envious, especially parents or teachers. Because in the rest of the world it''s not that, students don''t try that hard. Rufei: Yeah. Todd: So that''s kind of special, actually. Rufei: Yeah, I think that''s the special point of China. Todd: Wow. So, what time did you have to get up every day to get to school at 6:45? Rufei: I have to get up at 6:00. Todd: Oh, well that was not too bad. That''s pretty fast, you wake up at 6:00, you get to school by 6:45. Rufei: Yeah, I can wear my clothes pretty fast and directly get on my father''s car and eat on my father''s car and put my socks on, on my father''s car. Todd: Wow! Talk about streamlined, very mobile. That''s great. What about the tests? It''s really controversial in the US about standardized tests. Rather than just learning, the students often have to prepare for tests. In your country is there also a big movement just to have a lot of testing? Rufei: We have a test each month, and we only do paper tests. The questions can be really difficult, yeah always very, very difficult. In my case, I''m in the middle ... Todd: Middle of the pack, as we say. Rufei: Yeah, the middle of the pack. For mathematics, we have totally 150 scores and probably I can get 60 to 70. Todd: Wow, that''s a big range. Do some students get 100%? Rufei: No. Todd: No? Rufei: If you get more than 120, you are really brilliant. So the question''s always really, really difficult. Todd: Can the teacher get 150? Rufei: I''m not sure. Todd: Well I have to admit, because even English teachers will tell you, and they''re lying if they don''t admit this, even on tests like the TOEFL, it''s very hard for a teacher to get 100%. Not because of knowledge, but because of concentration. Rufei: Yes. Todd: Right? Rufei: Exactly. We have a lot of questions and some of them, they are kind of tricky. Todd: Right. Rufei: Yeah. Todd: So they mislead you a little bit. Rufei: Yeah. Todd: Oh no, that''s great. So you took all these courses, what was the course you were best at and the course you were worst at? Rufei: English was my worst at. Todd: Oh no, your English is wonderful! Really? Rufei: Yeah. Todd: Oh I disagree. Rufei: It was. Todd: Oh, OK. How do you learn English in China? Rufei: Actually, my speaking skills I gathered from my traveling, I did solo traveling last year. Todd: Wow, you''ve learned a lot, quickly. Rufei: Thank you. Todd: That''s great! That''s really inspirational I think for a lot of the students that listen to this site. One year? Rufei: Yeah. Todd: Fantastic. Rufei: But the thing I have to mention about is, you have to know a lot of words. Before you start to speak English, you have to know what you know. Like you have to remember a lot of words, and then you can use it when you have to use it. Todd: Okay, right. So English was tough, not easy. Rufei: Not easy, for everything you have to learn. Learning isn''t easy and funny stuff for everyone. Starting is hard and it''s kind of betray the human ... Todd: Spirit? Rufei: Yes. Todd: Wow, that''s crazy. So how many students would be in an English class? I hear that China has huge English classes. Like there might be 100 students in one class. Rufei: It can be, but it depends. In my high school we have the same class at the same classroom always, and in my university we have 30 students in my English. Todd: Oh okay, that''s kind of normal. That''s still a lot, for an English teacher that''s a lot. Were your teachers usually Chinese, or an international teacher? Rufei: Chinese teacher. Todd: Chinese teacher, okay. And so there was a big stress on grammar and vocabulary, things like that? Rufei: Yes. Todd: How about listening? Rufei: We only do the audio listening test. So it''s always the same pronunciation. Todd: Yeah, so you don''t have a lot of variety of accents? Rufei: Yes. Todd: Yeah. Okay, well you have to introduce ELLO to China, the website. Rufei: Yeah, cool. Todd: What was your best subject? Rufei: My best subject was mathematics. Todd: Oh great. Yeah, that''s impressive. I have a degree in economics and there''s a lot of math. I went to a good school but I was not strong at math and I was terrible at physics. And physics and economics are kind of related, but not really, I did not do very well in physics. So how are you at physics? Rufei: Actually I love all the math stuff, but also included physics, because you also have to use a lot of mathematics on your physics. For the physics you have to know the formula very well, then you can use it. If you don''t know the formula very well, when the question is there you cannot ... Todd: Apply? Rufei: ... apply that. Todd: Yeah. Oh yeah, I agree, it''s tough. I am very impressed with you because whenever I meet somebody who is good at math or physics, I have great admiration. My degree was math heavy, but math was not my strong point. Rufei: So what was your strong point? Todd: That''s a good question. I was never a good student at anything. How I got to a good university is actually surprising, but I was always middle of the road. Middle of the pack, as we said. Always B- student, in everything. Rufei: I see. Todd: Yeah, I was not exceptional like you. Rufei: You don''t have to be very good at starting, but you can handle your life very easily. That''s also an important thing for a human. Todd: That is true, I do agree with that. But I think if I was a student in China, I would be that Mister 2000. Rufei: Yes. Todd: Okay. There''s nothing you would change? Like if you were in charge would you give maybe a little more vacation time? Would you start the day later? Would you make classes smaller? Rufei: If I can choose I will definitely don''t choose my school because that was horrible for me because I need a lot of sleep than normal people, but I cannot have that much time to sleep. So I always sleep on the class, and when somebody found out that I am sleeping on the class they will decrease the score of my class. Todd: Oh, that''s serious. Rufei: Yes, very serious. Yeah, your teacher would punish you to write a paper like, "I am sorry I decreased the score of our class, I shouldn''t sleep on the class", and I have to write it for like an hour to write that stuff. Todd: That is very harsh. Rufei: Yeah. Todd: I think though a lot of people, when they hear stories like that they actually are a little bit envious, especially parents or teachers. Because in the rest of the world it''s not that, students don''t try that hard. Rufei: Yeah. Todd: So that''s kind of special, actually. Rufei: Yeah, I think that''s the special point of China. Todd: Wow. So, what time did you have to get up every day to get to school at 6:45? Rufei: I have to get up at 6:00. Todd: Oh, well that was not too bad. That''s pretty fast, you wake up at 6:00, you get to school by 6:45. Rufei: Yeah, I can wear my clothes pretty fast and directly get on my father''s car and eat on my father''s car and put my socks on, on my father''s car. Todd: Wow! Talk about streamlined, very mobile. That''s great. What about the tests? It''s really controversial in the US about standardized tests. Rather than just learning, the students often have to prepare for tests. In your country is there also a big movement just to have a lot of testing? Rufei: We have a test each month, and we only do paper tests. The questions can be really difficult, yeah always very, very difficult. In my case, I''m in the middle ... Todd: Middle of the pack, as we say. Rufei: Yeah, the middle of the pack. For mathematics, we have totally 150 scores and probably I can get 60 to 70. Todd: Wow, that''s a big range. Do some students get 100%? Rufei: No. Todd: No? Rufei: If you get more than 120, you are really brilliant. So the question''s always really, really difficult. Todd: Can the teacher get 150? Rufei: I''m not sure. Todd: Well I have to admit, because even English teachers will tell you, and they''re lying if they don''t admit this, even on tests like the TOEFL, it''s very hard for a teacher to get 100%. Not because of knowledge, but because of concentration. Rufei: Yes. Todd: Right? Rufei: Exactly. We have a lot of questions and some of them, they are kind of tricky. Todd: Right. Rufei: Yeah. Todd: So they mislead you a little bit. Rufei: Yeah. Todd: Oh no, that''s great. So you took all these courses, what was the course you were best at and the course you were worst at? Rufei: English was my worst at. Todd: Oh no, your English is wonderful! Really? Rufei: Yeah. Todd: Oh I disagree. Rufei: It was. Todd: Oh, OK. How do you learn English in China? Rufei: Actually, my speaking skills I gathered from my traveling, I did solo traveling last year. Todd: Wow, you''ve learned a lot, quickly. Rufei: Thank you. Todd: That''s great! That''s really inspirational I think for a lot of the students that listen to this site. One year? Rufei: Yeah. Todd: Fantastic. Rufei: But the thing I have to mention about is, you have to know a lot of words. Before you start to speak English, you have to know what you know. Like you have to remember a lot of words, and then you can use it when you have to use it. Todd: Okay, right. So English was tough, not easy. Rufei: Not easy, for everything you have to learn. Learning isn''t easy and funny stuff for everyone. Starting is hard and it''s kind of betray the human ... Todd: Spirit? Rufei: Yes. Todd: Wow, that''s crazy. So how many students would be in an English class? I hear that China has huge English classes. Like there might be 100 students in one class. Rufei: It can be, but it depends. In my high school we have the same class at the same classroom always, and in my university we have 30 students in my English. Todd: Oh okay, that''s kind of normal. That''s still a lot, for an English teacher that''s a lot. Were your teachers usually Chinese, or an international teacher? Rufei: Chinese teacher. Todd: Chinese teacher, okay. And so there was a big stress on grammar and vocabulary, things like that? Rufei: Yes. Todd: How about listening? Rufei: We only do the audio listening test. So it''s always the same pronunciation.

In America, Chinese students have a reputation of being very hard-working. Is that true? Rufei: Yes, exactly. In my high school, in one class we have around 70 students in one class and everybody wants to be the top student, so everybody works so hard. I say my high school was kind of like a prison. You have to go to school every day from 6:35 AM to 9:40 PM. Todd: Really? That long? Rufei: Yes. Todd: That''s over 12 hours; that''s like 13, 14 hours a day! Rufei: Yes, exactly. Todd: How did you feel as a student studying that much? Rufei: Sleepy. Todd: I bet. Rufei: Every day I''m so sleepy. Todd: I can imagine. Do you think it was productive studying that much? Rufei: I think their purpose just like as to stay as much time as we can in the school and we cannot get distracted by other stuff, so we always stay at school and we always focus on our studying ... We cannot know anything about the outside of the wall from school. Todd: That''s amazing. For such a long day, can you talk about the daily schedule? What was your schedule like everyday? Rufei: From 6:50, we start to have class. From 6:50 until maybe 11:45; we have 45 minutes class and then 10 minutes break. We also have 30 minutes we have to do exercise on the playground and, in the afternoon, is the same routine. Then, we went to dinner around 6:00 to 7:00. From 7:00 to 9:40 we have to do our homework. Todd: So, you study at school? It''s not homework, it''s school work; you don''t actually go home, right? Rufei: Yeah. Todd: That''s crazy. How many classes would you have every day? Rufei: Eight classes. Todd: What were the subjects? Rufei: We separate the subject. If you learn more Mathematics, we learn mathematics, English, and Chinese, and physics, chemistry, and biology. Todd: That''s very rigorous. Did you enjoy all the subjects? Rufei: Yeah. I love physics and biology and chemistry. Todd: Now you are training to be a doctor? Rufei: Yeah. Todd: That''s fantastic. Did you know you wanted to be a doctor when you were in high school? Rufei: I kind of know because my father is a doctor and he was kind of forcing me to study medicine. Todd: Nice. We have a phrase in English; we say, "Follow in your father''s footsteps." You definitely are following in your father''s footsteps. That''s great. Is your mother a doctor? Rufei: My mother is a businesswoman now. Todd: Okay, great. You had all these courses. In America, there''s a big controversy about tests, that the kids take too many tests; it''s too test driven. What about in China? Do you have a lot of tests? Rufei: Yeah, I have test every month. They will make a list of every single person; how much score you got in this test- Todd: Whoa. They rank everybody to see- Rufei: Yes. Todd: That''s very competitive. Rufei: Yeah. I think that''s kind of bad for our emotion. Todd: Yeah, so it creates a lot of stress. Rufei: Yeah. We have 2000 students in one grade. Todd: That is crazy. So, you can be number 2000, you can be the lowest student? Rufei: Yes. Todd: And they put that out there? Rufei: Yes. Todd: Really? They could never do that in America. Rufei: Yeah, I think so. Todd: Oh my gosh. Do you think that''s a good idea? Rufei: Depends on the person. Todd: Right; yeah. Wow. You have a lot of pressure. Did you feel pressure from your parents, from your peers, from your teachers? Rufei: Yeah. Todd: Who gave you the most pressure? Rufei: Myself. Todd: That''s good. Rufei: I don''t want to be lazy. I don''t want to be worse, so I have to always work hard to chasing other people ... Everybody wants to be the best, so everybody worked really, really hard. Even we have breaking time, they don''t break at all. Todd: Seriously? Rufei: Yes. Todd: What do they do during the break? Rufei: They do questions. Todd: Wow. They quiz each other? The students quiz each other or they just do homework? Rufei: They do their homework and they find out what problem they''ve had and they solve the problem with teachers or other students. They just starting all day; they can''t do that. Todd: That''s amazing. Kids do this 14, 15 hours a day? Rufei: Yeah. Todd: Wow. That''s really good for China! Rufei: We don''t have that much summer vacation and winter vacation. In winter vacation, we have two weeks because of the Chinese New Year; it''s about two weeks off. We have two weeks in winter vacation and one week summer vacation only. Todd: Is that enough? Rufei: Of course not. Even we have vacation, the teacher would give us a lot of homework to do.

He''s a famous writer, yeah? Hana: Mm-hmm Ben: Yeah, this is actually a story about a .... It''s kind of a sci-fi horror mix, so it''s like, of course it''s one of my favorites.

Ben: And you can download that and you can keep it and listen to it as many times as you want for free. Hana: Yeah. Ben: And you didn''t pay ... I didn''t pay Madonna anything. Hana: No. Ben: Right? In that way, I think the music industry has changed a lot. Hana: Yeah, I think so. Ben: Yeah, yeah. I''m not sure if it''s good or bad, probably bad. Hana: You think? Ben: For artists I think it''s not good. Hana: For artists. Yeah. Ben: Especially if they''re not as popular, so if they do not have a very big record deal. Hana: Yeah. Ben: How do they ... How are they going to get profit? If there''s someone like less popular, someone independent artist, like the lower level not so popular artists, they don''t make money. Hana: No, but I mean, I think recently, I think it''s a good thing that people sort of can find non-famous singers on YouTube or on internet. I listen to radio and while I drive I listen to radio often and I also listen to music on YouTube. The other day accidentally I found ... Maybe it''s not even a singer, it''s just an ordinary person singing somebody''s song by her ... I thought he is great and I start listening to his songs and I subscribe his channel and in that way, unknown ... Well, famous people can become famous and they can make money and sort of ... In that sense, YouTube or those internet websites or apps can give them opportunity for ... Ben: That''s true. I think ... I totally agree with you and I think in that way, that''s ... I guess YouTube and the internet has helped lesser known artists become exposed. Hana: Yes. Ben: Right? Hana: Exactly. Ben: So there''s exposure with YouTube, right? So there''s all these view count, right? You can suggest a YouTube video to a friend, you can share it on your Facebook page. Hana: Yeah. Ben: Definitely in that way YouTube has totally changed ... Have you heard the term go viral before? Hana: No. What does that mean? Ben: Go viral means that a video that''s put on video gets a lot of hits, a lot of views very, very, very quickly, so it gets seen by a lot of people. Viral, like a virus, right? It spreads through the internet. Hana: Okay. Ben: There are some unknown artists that started out with just a YouTube video and that video went viral, right? It received many views, many people saw it, and now they''re popular musicians that people know about. Hana: Right? Like Justin Bieber, yeah? Ben: You know what? I think you''re right. Didn''t his parents put him on YouTube when he was a kid? Hana: I guess so, yeah. Ben: I think something ... Hana: That''s how he started, yeah? Ben: Right. Yeah, in that way you can become ... Hana: A pop star. Ben: A pop star, right? Hana: Yeah. Ben: Just from posting a YouTube video that gets seen.

Shantel: Yes. I moved to Bologna. Bologna, Italy. Todd: Wow that''s such a huge transition, what was that like? Why did you move to Italy? Shantel: Oh wow. So I moved to Italy because I was studying abroad during my junior year at university. And so, I was to do an immersion program at the University of Bologna, which means all of my classes were in Italian. All of my homework, all of my exams, everything was completely in Italian. And I also had to find my own housing, which was also the first time I found housing on my own ''cause I had always lived in the university dorms at my university in the United States. And so, yeah. To navigate one a new city, a city in general and then finding my first apartment, and learning how to survive a new university system. It was exhilarating and very exciting. Yeah, I loved it. Todd: That''s so cool. So, what was it like when you first got to Italy? Did you have culture shock? You came from a small town environment and now you''re living in a big city in Europe. Shantel: I think my friends would probably say that I was very quick to trust everyone. As I mentioned before growing up in a small town, I knew all my neighbors and I was very trusting of strangers and very welcoming, and I still am. But in hindsight, when I moved to Italy I think I was maybe a little too naive sometimes and especially not knowing the language, it was easy to sort of put my trust or my faith in someone when I needed help because I needed help often, whether for translating or even just grocery shopping. And so, sometimes I think I look back I''m like, "Oh, maybe I should have walked away a little bit sooner," or something like that. Todd: Right. Yeah. Compare life in Italy to life in the states. What was it like? How was it different? Shantel: Life in Italy feels so much slower. People are still very productive and they''re very passionate and they go to their jobs and they go to work, but there''s just this sense of how important it is to enjoy your time, and to enjoy your time with family and with friends. So for example, I feel like in the United States people ... and this is very general, but I feel like people have their jobs and they work really hard to the point where maybe they''re so tired they go home and they just want to watch Netflix or watch TV and relax, and that''s their way of relaxing is being at home. And in Italy it feels like the way people recharge and the way that they relax and get their energy back is being in the company of their friends, and being in the company of their family. So they''ll finish work and everyone will meet up for a drink in the center of town. And it''s not to drink a lot it''s really just to have a glass of wine, eat some delicious food, and just sit and talk, but about nothing really. Just enjoy the time and eventually people decide to go home, but it''ll be hours later even though they''re exhausted from work. But that''s how they relax and that''s how they get their energy back. And they go to work the next day and are productive. I really enjoyed that the most. Todd: I can relate to that. I was in Spain for about two months just traveling around and the one thing that I still remember the most is that I would go into a little pub, or a bar late at night, 10:00 a night and there would be old people. And I''m not talking like 50 or 60, I''m talking like 75 years old maybe. And they''re well-dressed, and they''re sitting at a table with their friends, and I can never imagine that happening in the United States. And it was so impressive. I was so impressed by that. That people really in the later years of their life still had that social spirit. They go out, they socialize, they have a good time. And we''re talking late at night, like 10:00. You would never see that in America, ever. Shantel: Yeah. I completely agree. And it''s very similar in Italy too. Todd: So, what about the food? I hear the food is fantastic. Everyone raves about Italian food. Shantel: Yes. It is so good. And I probably, wow, where to begin with food? I love the cheeses. There''s just so many different kinds of cheese. I''m a huge cheese, meat, jam person. So the combination of having all of that available in Italy, especially the different regions are known for different foods. So sometimes you can''t even eat a specific type of food unless you''re in that city, otherwise you''d have to pay a lot to get it at a different part of the country. So, yeah I mean pizzas were delicious too. I know it''s stereotypical but the pizzas were awesome and they''re so different than the U.S. they''re so thin, super, super thin there''s no like deep dish pizza in Italy or double crust or cheese filled crust, that doesn''t exist. Todd: Exactly. Like it melts in your mouth, right? Shantel: Yeah. It''s so delicious. And pastas of course are great. Their wines are delicious too. Yeah, I miss Italian food a lot. A lot. Todd: Well, I am thinking of going there so you''ll have to give me some tips. Shantel: I would love to.

And we both are teachers in Japan. So I thought we would talk a little bit about some of the stereotypes that people might have in other countries, for example Japan, or other countries about Americans. So first, we''re going to talk about hamburgers. Shantel: Okay. Todd: Okay, so hamburgers. How often do you actually eat a hamburger? Shantel: Uh, hamburgers. I would say, it''s actually not that often, although I love hamburgers. I love them very much, but maybe only a couple times a month or so. Todd: Yeah, I agree. I think hamburgers is the one thing that does not meet the stereotype, that we don''t eat them that often. Like, I never have hamburgers in America. Shantel: Ah, okay. Todd: Pretty much never. Like, I''ll have them if somebody''s barbecuing it, maybe for a picnic, or something. Um, yeah. And if I do eat fast food it''s usually not a hamburger. Shantel: Oh. Todd: I eat something else. Like, I eat tacos or burritos, right. Shantel: Yeah. Todd: I don''t eat hamburgers. So that''s one. I think hamburgers don''t really match the stereotype myth. Shantel: Yeah. I agree. Todd: Do you agree? Shantel: I agree, especially because I know many, many of my students here in Japan, they will ask me often, what I eat for lunch. And before I respond, cause they''re playing a joke on me, they''ll say like, "Oh, hamburger? Hamburger?" Todd: (laughs), yeah. Shantel: And I have to tell them that, you know, now I do live in Japan, but in the United States I don''t typically eat hamburgers every day. Todd: Yeah. Shantel: But that is a lot of what they think. They think that I eat hamburgers regularly or, at least, fast food but their image of fast food is only hamburgers. Todd: So true. And actually,the funny side story to that, or contrary story would be you know, sushi. So we both teach in Japan, and I think most people think that you eat sushi all the time in Japan. And that''s almost the equivalent of the hamburger. You don''t eat it that much. Shantel: That is so true. Todd: Right? Shantel: So true. I cannot say how true that is. Todd: Or uh, another one, we''re talking about um, stereotypes would be sumo. So Japanese people are not that into sumo, really, right, but it''s an iconic thing. So that brings us to the point of baseball. Shantel: Ah, yes. Todd: So do you actually like baseball? Shantel: I do. I love baseball. I do, and I used to go to some games in the United States, in San Francisco. I went to several Giants games growing up, yeah. So I do enjoy baseball. Do you enjoy baseball? Todd: I do. I have to admit, like I played you know, baseball when I was younger. I loved baseball, but I do think it''s not as popular as people think it is. Shantel: Ah. Todd: You know what I mean? Shantel: Yes. Todd: I think that like, a lot of people like it. You like it, I like it. But a lot of people could care less. Shantel: Yes. Todd: About baseball. Shantel: Most of the time I think I hear people say it''s, it''s a slow sport, it''s boring. No one wants to watch it. Todd: Right.

If you don''t have the opportunity to travel to the country that speak that language, just do classes, lessons, try to talk to native people, watch films, games, and practice as much, either with classes or apps or anything you have at your disposal. And of course, the number one thing would be to just travel to a country, and immerse yourself there. Best, if no one speaks any language that you know.

There has to be a reason for you to learn so that you have the motivation to continue and to do so. For example, if it allows you to meet new people or it allows you to get a job, or if you like the way it sounds or it''s written, that will give you motivation when it gets hard, and generally, it always gets hard because all languages have some kind of barrier. The second one is that you need to surround yourself with material that is in this language. For example, movies or music, or talking to people who are native to this language, so that you are in constant contact with this language. And the third one is that you need to practice, because even if you have completely learned a language, which is not something that generally can happen because there is always something new to learn, but even when you have a high level of it, if you don''t practice, you will lose it and you will not even notice when you''re losing it.

There are so many I can think of, off top of my head. Nothing is, like, that big that people would be extremely offended that I think, or you know, is like super superstitious. Brazil is a very big and diverse country from, you know, cultures from all over the world, from Europeans to Africans, even Japanese in there, so all those things kind of mix up in a very big melting pot of culture and taboos. But the first thing that came to my mind, funny enough, is it''s kind of considered rude to arrive either early or right at the time at a dinner party, for example. Often in Brazil when you say dinner is at nine and you''re going to a friend''s house, it''s customary to be like, you know, 20 minutes, half an hour late, it''s customary, not too late but definitely not too early, for some reason, so that''s the first and funniest taboo I can think of about Brazilian culture.

Patricia: Just wanted to know your take on how you think this will change our society. The advancements that have been made so far in AI and robotics. John: Well, I mean, already we''ve seen there''s a huge push towards whether it''s AI in think tanks or things of that nature to people just exploring the idea of AI in terms of writing their own books, poetry, art. AI that is painting. I think the possibilities are endless. We will see development and exploration into ideas and areas we''ve never even thought of. Think about the idea of an AI painter or sculptor. They can probably pull the knowledge of all the painters and artists of the world and come together to form some entirely new form of expressionism or something of that nature. The idea of AI in medicine. It can look at exploring different ways of doing things, things that humans have never thought of and because of the sheer speed at which computers can process and, for lack of a better word think, the potential for growth in this area I think is endless. Patricia: Overall do you think these things will improve or worsen our society? John: Well, like anything, I think it has a potential to do both. If we''re not careful, it could lead to the corruption of minds, the abuse of these advancements to either oppress people or subjugate them. With the proper minds at the helm, this could serve to benefit humanity. If we have AI taking care of things like surgeries, exploration into dangerous areas, humans no longer need to endanger themselves to engage in exploration. These AIs can do the exploration for us, and we can benefit from what they find. That''s not to say that humans can''t still be exploring and expose themselves to all these amazing new things, it just means that we can take out some of that crazy level of danger and reduce that down so that humans can spend their time exploring other past times, other leisure activities to improve their minds, their bodies, their souls, however you want to put it. Patricia: Interesting, very interesting ideas. If you could have AI or a robot to help you with something in your everyday life, what do you think you would want help with? What would you use a robot for? John: What activities, tasks? Basically would be like a personal assistant. I would have somebody to help me organize my day, my activities. Help me stay on tasks, stay focused, take care of cleaning. I love cooking so I would probably still want to engage in some of that myself, but there may be days where I''m busy, so an AI whether it''s in robot form or something like that, to take care of those tasks for me so that I can be more productive in the other areas of my life that need it would be fantastic. Patricia: Yeah, I agree. I would love to have someone who could do chores around the house for me, like cleaning. Yeah, thanks for your ideas, John. It was awesome to talk to you. John: Not a problem. I look forward to it, the next, sorry.

Patricia, is it changing people for the better or for the worse? Patricia: I think it''s doing both. It depends on the person. I think technology is an amazing tool and resource, but I also think that people can become easily addicted to things. John: I agree. Patricia: Yeah, like their phones or social media. So, I mean, it''s like anything in life, it has its advantages and disadvantages. John: What do you think is one of the biggest advantages it has for us right now? Patricia: I think information. You know, we can access information so easily now. We can look up, you know, anything we can dream of doing; we can Google it and find either a tutorial or a book. There''s just endless information about every topic. And then, if you can''t find what you''re looking for, you can write about what you''re looking for yourself online and help other people. So, you know, that is huge right now. John: Okay. What about a negative for technology? Something you think it''s doing to, you know, impact us negatively? Patricia: I mean, it definitely impacts our relationships, especially if they are more inclined to be introverted; they''re not forced to go outside their comfort zone so much. They can stay home and send messages or just stay home and play video games and not really... John: Engage? Patricia: ... engage in socializing with an actual human being. And I think while it is nice to be able to exchange messages easily, I also think that that is not, that doesn''t take the place of actually talking to a human face to face. I think our society still needs that in-person connection. And I think, you know, some people aren''t getting that anymore because they''re so involved with their online presence or, yeah. John: Okay. Now, I think a big part of that is the technological advances surrounding, things like social media. How do you feel about children being exposed to social media or things like that? Patricia: I definitely think it should be limited for them. Parents really need to be a role model for their children and put boundaries in place for themselves as well. I think that''s the best way to be a good role model for children, by limiting their own screen time and what they''re doing on social media so that children can learn what is healthy. I think it''s all about balance. There needs to be a healthy balance. And if, you know, parents find that their children are spending too much time in front of a screen or on social media, or, you know, they''re being bullied, I think they need to be involved and they need to set boundaries for their kids where those things are concerned. John: Okay. Last question for you. What do you think is the most important and beneficial technological advance, sorry, beneficial technological advancement that we''ve seen? Doesn''t have to be today, you can go all the way back to whenever. Patricia: Probably, I mean, technological advancement in medicine is probably the thing that has seriously affected our society and our world the most, you know, being able to mass produce vaccines comes to mind or, you know, robots who can perform surgery. Things like that I think have actually really made a big difference in people''s everyday lives around the globe. John: Nice. All right. Well, that''s all the questions I have for you.

I have a question for you. Do you ever meditate? Haruka: Only occasionally. I know it''s very good for your mental health, but I forget all the time. Do you? Mark: I do, but not in the most traditional or usual way. I don''t sit in silence very often. I do that too sometimes, but I''ll meditate either by going through a guided meditation, like a voice, someone telling me to relax your shoulders and focus on your breathing, et cetera. Or I meditate at other times like when I''m doing the dishes. I just focus on just the act of the water going over my hands or cleaning the dishes. And that''s a form of meditation to me. Haruka: Do you feel much better after that? Mark: I feel calmer. I certainly feel more relaxed. Yeah. I feel like when I do that, my mind usually is going very fast and it''s a good way to slow it down and bring it back to a more tolerable way of thinking. Haruka: Is meditation similar to zoning out? Mark: I guess, but to me, zoning out is letting your mind wander. Whereas meditation, you''re bringing it to a single focal point. Haruka: I see. Actually, I remember that I have used this app called Undo. It''s a very simple three minutes or whatever minutes you choose. And it start with a bamboo sound. And I like it and I feel, yeah, much calmer after that meditation. Mark: Yeah. I have the same app. That is the one time I will do a silent meditation. I''ll use that app because, like you said, there''s this bamboo sound at the beginning and a gong at the end, but it''s just silent in between. Other than meditation, what else do you do when you get stressed out? Haruka: Recently, I do try to do deeper breathing, inhale and exhale. And also looking at the window, mountains, skies, feeling the breeze. They are all very calming to me. How about you? Mark: If I get stressed out or if I''m unhappy, I try to think about other people. What could I do for someone else to make them happy? How could I surprise someone, something like that. Haruka: That''s very nice of you. Mark: Yeah, I guess. It just, it helps me. Because if I don''t do tat, I will probably focus too much on whatever''s making me unhappy or stressed out.

When did you start learning it? Mark: I started learning about Zen philosophy when I was in college Haruka: In college? Mark: Yeah. Zen''s not really a religion, but I''ve studied it in a religion class. It comes from Buddhism originally. Haruka: Was it a Japanese teacher? Mark: No, but it was an Asian studies teacher. So he was an expert in Asian religions. Haruka: And what was the concept of Zen by that teacher? Mark: Well, it''s difficult to explain, but Zen is basically about appreciating the little moments in life and being in the present moment. A lot of times we think about the future or we spend a lot of time thinking about the past. Zen is mostly about trying to be in the right now. Haruka Sounds like mindfulness. Mark: It''s very close to that. Mindfulness is discussed a lot in Zen philosophy. Haruka : So, is there a way to be good at Zen or, what I can do to- Mark: I think I understand your question. There is no good or bad about it. It''s really like, do you like taking a walk in nature sometime? Haruka: I love it. Mark: Yeah, me too. And I think that in essence is Zen is just appreciating the beauty in nature or the wind on your face, or, the sound of the birds and the trees. It sounds a little corny, but appreciating that moment in time, that''s basically Zen. Haruka: So if I''m enjoying this conversation right now, that means I am in Zen? Mark: Sure. In essence, if you''re in this moment, as we speak, that''s a form of Zen appreciation. Haruka: Is it possible that I will be in Zen all the time, if I''m able to enjoy every moment of my life? Mark: That''s a great question. I think it''s sort of impossible to constantly be present. It''s a good goal to aim for, but it''s sort of like an unattainable goal, like a goal that you can''t ever get to because your mind is at some point going to think about tomorrow or remember something from the past. Haruka: How much of a day do you think you are in the Zen moment? Mark: I''ve never calculated it like that. I don''t know, because I catch myself all the time thinking too much about the future or reliving a memory for too long. And then when I catch myself, I bring my focus back to what I''m doing at the present moment. Haruka : Mm. Sometimes I focus so much and I feel like I''m in the zone, but it''s different from Zen? Mark: Well, I don''t really want to define it because that''s the paradox or the confusing thing about Zen, the more and more you try to define it, really, the further away you get from it. It''s not something that there are like rules that are written down and you follow these rules. It''s really more about just being, just being alive and acknowledging that, appreciating that. Haruka: Maybe we can both go to the Zen garden and see how it works. Mark: That''s good.

We both have experience with the West. Actually, we’re both Westerners and we also have worked and lived in Thailand. Have you noticed the difference in the flow of money? Which I think is quite interesting. So in a lot of Asian cultures, especially Thailand, the flow of money goes from the children up. Angela: Yes. Todd: Whereas in the West, the flow of money goes from… Angela: Parents down. Todd: … the parents down or the older the family member down. Angela: Yes. Todd: It’s a completely different flow, which is quite interesting when you think about it. Angela: Isn’t it? Because, you know, a lot of the people that work in Bangkok and some of the tourist places in Thailand, they send money home. They don’t earn money for their own keep and their own life. They actually send money home to the villages to pay for their children, to pay for their mothers, and I think it affects the way the people respect people within the family. There’s huge respect for older people in Thailand that I didn’t notice in the West, and I think it may be something to do with the fact that they are still giving to their parents? Todd: Yeah, you know, that’s so true. I think also the fact that the family is almost like a bank. Angela: Yes. Todd: And they have a pool of wealth that they use together as a unit, which I think is just a great concept. Angela: Yeah. Todd: Although when I say this, I don’t give money up to my mother so… But I’m always thinking I wish my family did this. Our family in the West, we should adopt this practice. You know, everybody gives 10% to the pool, to the family pool. Angela: Yes. Todd: But I don’t know if it would ever work. Angela: I don’t know if it would work, no. Todd: I mean, so you have kids. Angela: Yes. Todd: How would you feel if suddenly your children started giving you 10% of everything they made? Angela: Great. Wouldn’t that be wonderful? But it’s not going to happen. Todd: Right. Angela: It’s just not in our society. Todd: Yeah. But you wouldn’t spend it though, right? Like the whole idea is like they just give it to the – like you would be the guardian, you would be the safe keeper of the money. Angela: Yeah, I’d probably have the money and then put the money away for them. Todd: Right. Angela: Because I think that the pressures in the West are different, as well. You know, it’s very hard for people to become house owners. So for my kids, it’s going to be very, very difficult for them to go on the property ladder. So if they gave me any money, I would give it back to them as a deposit. Todd: Yeah. You know, although there is one other thing that goes the other way, which is in Japan… I hope I say this right. I think it’s called otoshidama. Basically, you get money from your relatives. If you’re a child or a kid, you get money from your relatives on January 1st. They give you an envelope and sometimes kids might get $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 dollars on New Year’s, depending how wealthy your family is. And I think there’s Chinese New Year, maybe they do something similar. The kids get money, I’m not sure. So there is the other flow where families do give kids money, I think. And also, I remember years ago, when I first came to Thailand I was talking with a guy and I said, “Yeah, you know one thing that shocked me about kids in Thailand is they don’t… Nobody works. They don’t have part-time jobs. Not that many have part-time jobs.” Although it’s changed. I said, “In America, you work and it’s a good thing, like you build values.” And he said, “Yeah, well, you know, in Thailand they can’t do that because if a child works, especially for a middle class family, it’s an embarrassment to the family. Like the father can’t provide for his children. His children have to work when they should be studying.” So it’s really interesting the different dynamics in money across cultures.', '{"difficulty_code": "B2", "duration_type": "conversations", "source": "downloaded_dataset"}', 'en-US', 'Usa, - Switzerland', 120, '2024-01-01 00:00:00', '2024-01-01 00:00:00', 1, 1, 0);

Hana:Right? Ben:So, TV shows? Hana: Yes. Ben: Yeah. While you were learning English, what are some shows you watched? Something I wanna tell my students they can watch. Hana: My favorite all time is the TV drama called Friends. Ben: Oh, yeah! Yeah. Hana: Have you seen it before? Ben: Friends is super popular in the U.S. Yeah, yeah. Hana: It is, yes. I mean, first of all, I just love the story. Ben: Okay. Hana: Other than just learning English, it''s second purpose, I guess. There was an Italian or there is a character who is playboy and he used to say like, "How you doin''?" Yeah? And, it''s interesting is, first, I watched the drama with my first language subtitled. Ben: Oh, right. Hana: Yeah. Ben: So, you''re watching in English with your language in the subtitles? Hana: Yes. Ben: Okay. Hana: So that I can understand the main concept first. Ben: Right. Hana: And then, gradually, I changed to English subtitles. Ben: Oh, okay. That''s a great idea! So, first, to understand the meaning of what''s being said, subtitles. Then, to maybe watch it again a second time or even a third time to understand exactly how the English is used in context of the show. Hana: True, yeah. Ben: Okay, that''s a great strategy. Hana: That way you can enjoy just watching the movies or dramas and that way you can spend a lot more time, rather than just trying to study English. Ben: Right, so it''s more ... a way to enjoy learning English and studying. Hana: Yes. Ben: Actually, you know ... You said Friends, right? Hana: Yep, yep. Ben: So I think Friends is on ... It''s so popular, right? And it''s all over the internet. I believe it''s on YouTube. You can watch it on YouTube and Netflix. Hana: Netflix, yeah. Ben: Yeah, Netflix. One thing that''s great about YouTube, I think, is that they have a closed captioning or a subtitling option, so if you can''t exactly catch what they''re saying while you''re listening the first time, you can put the subtitles on like you said. Hana: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Ben: That''s a great- Hana: And there are so many websites that shows the transcripts of the ... Ben: That''s true. You can read the scripts from the show to follow along, as well. Hana: Mm-hmm. Ben: That''s great. So you said you watch Friends, right? Hana: I do. Ben: Are there any others that you''ve heard of? Friends, I know is popular. Many people know Friends. Hana: Full House. Ben: Full House, yeah! Hana: Full House, yes. Ben: Okay, you know they recently did a revamp, a newer version it. Hana: Yeah, they did. Yeah, I haven''t seen it yet but, yeah, it''s good. Good, good. Ben: I haven''t either. Well, you recommend either Friends or Full House. Hana: One of my friends, he liked a drama called Prison Break. Ben: Oh, that''s on Netflix, as well. Hana: Have you ever heard it? Yeah. Ben: Yeah, I have. Hana: He watched like 60 hours or more than that and I asked him, "How''s it going? Is it good?" He did understand without subtitles, which is good. And so, I asked him, "So you can speak English now, yeah? Can you use those phrases from the drama?" And he said, "Actually, not." I said, "Why?" It''s because the words that they use from the drama. There''s a bombing or escaping or something that''s not daily life conversations, so that way Friends or Full House that people in daily life. Ben: That''s daily English. Yeah, daily life English. Hana: Yeah, so I found it easier to use. Ben: Okay, so you recommend- Hana: Yeah, yeah. Ben: Okay, yeah. That''s great. Thank you so much. I think my students would love to watch that kind of drama and learn daily- Hana: Daily, yes. Ben: ... actual phrases you can use. Thanks so much for the tips. Thanks, Hana.

Viyasan: I would say this talent spreads a long time back and it''s always something I''m very envious about. I don''t have the best memory and so I really wish that my talent was to remember a lot easier or even have photographic memory. I think that would be very useful, especially as a student during exams where we''re able to read quite a bit and remember all of it. I think that talent would be interesting to have because I wouldn''t always be forgetting daily things, like my keys to my apartment. Gyri: Right. Viyasan: Or for example, my water bottle every single time I leave for class. I think memory is very important and it''s very good to remember certain conversations with people. For example, sometimes I might have a conversation with someone and completely forget that I talked about that topic and then just be reminded of it when I talk to that person the next time. Gyri: Yeah. Viyasan: I think having a better memory or photographic memory would be great for those situations. Gyri: Yeah, definitely. Viyasan: And yourself? What are some talents that you wish you had? Gyri: I wish that I could dance. I have no rhythm at all. Viyasan: Yeah. Gyri: I feel so stupid when like if we go out or we listen to music, I just look really goofy when I try to dance, but I feel like dancing so I still try, but it just looks horrible. Yeah, I wish I had more rhythm and the ability to learn dance moves, I guess. Viyasan: Yeah, I would say that dancing is definitely a talent that some people have. Likewise, I do not have any rhythm so I''ll join you on that same dance floor. Gyri: Yeah. Viyasan: Even though I like to dance, I don''t dance very well. Gyri: Yeah. Yeah, I wish that I was better at sports as well. I really like downhill skiing, for example, but I never skied a lot, like my dad, he skied professionally when he was young, and I''m kind of bitter that he didn''t take me up to the hills more than he did because if I had started at a young age I could be really good right now, but I didn''t, so I''m a casual skier but I really wish that I could be like better than average in something, especially a sport. Viyasan: Got it, got it. Gyri: Do you play any sports besides basketball? Viyasan: Basketball is my main sport. I used to play a little bit of volleyball when I was in high school and so I played the position of setter and so that was very fun. It took a lot of accuracy. I think if I had to be a little bit more talented, it would be at jumping because if I was able to jump a lot more, I would be able to fake my sets and just hit the ball down on the opponent''s side. That would be a cool talent to have if I was able to jump maybe five to ten more inches higher than I usually did. I still remember that my vertical was 26 inches when I was in grade nine or grade ten and so maybe if I added a couple more inches onto that I would''ve been able to perform in more creative ways. Gyri: Yeah. Viyasan: Yeah. Gyri: Can you dunk a basketball? Viyasan: That depends on how high the rim is. If it''s five feet or six feet, definitely, but on a standard regulation net, which is probably nine or 9.5 feet, I cannot. Gyri: Okay. Viyasan: But maybe if I had the talent of jumping extremely high, I would be able to dunk a basketball but no. Gyri: Can you dribble with your left hand? Viyasan: Of course. I can dribble with my let hand, I can dribble with my right hand, I can dribble between my legs. I''ve done a lot of different types of basketball drills when I was on the high school team and so yeah, I''m pretty good at handling the basketball. Shooting, driving to the net, and passing it a lot quite a bit, so yeah, pretty efficient with the basketball. Gyri: Yeah, that''s impressive. Viyasan: I just can''t dunk. Gyri: Okay, yeah. Can you shoot with your left hand? Viyasan: Mm, no, I cannot. I can''t shoot with my left hand. I can do a lay up with my left hand, but I can''t shoot the ball naturally like a free throw or three point shot with my left hand. Gyri: Okay. What exactly is a lay up? Viyasan: A lay up is when you drive towards the net, you''re allowed to take two steps while holding the basketball and so that''s usually how people when they''re very close to the net, they do a lay up or they''re also able to convert a lay up into a dunk so they''re able to take two steps and dunk towards the basketball net. Gyri: Okay. Viyasan: Yeah, that''s a little bit of basketball knowledge for you.

Rachel: That''s the famous one. Todd: Right. Rachel: They don''t fly but they can run very fast. I''ve seen them. Todd: Like and are the kiwi all over? Like are there different types of kiwi? Rachel: Yeah, there are several different varieties. They''re very rare though, and they''re nocturnal. Todd: Oh, nocturnal. Rachel: I''d say most New Zealanders have never seen one in the wild. I''ve only seen them in Kiwi parks. Todd: Oh, really. Rachel: Yeah, you don''t see them. Todd: So, I thought they''d be like kangaroos in Australia, or something like you go and there''s one. Rachel: No, they''re very precious and very rare. One that you see more often is the pukeko which is ... it looks a little bit like a stork I suppose except it''s dark blue. Todd: What''s it called? Rachel: Pukeko. Todd: Pukeko. Rachel: Ah, yeah, and they''re a lot more common. And takahe is another one Todd: So the first one ... Rachel: You can see them along the side of the road. When you''re driving through the countryside they''re much more common. Todd: So this pukeko, does it fly? Rachel: No, they don''t fly. Todd: Really, and it''s like a stork. It has long legs? Rachel: It has quite long legs. Yeah, it a very cute little bird, but it''s very dark. Todd: How tall is it? Like up to your knee? Up to your hip? Rachel: Up to your knees. Todd: Really. Rachel: Cute little bird. Todd: That''s awesome. So what was the other one you mentioned? Rachel: Takahe. It''s very similar looking to that one. It''s a little different. It''s difficult to tell apart. Todd: Really, and it''s also kind of dark blueish. Rachel: Yeah, another one''s a kakapo. A very famous one. It''s New Zealand''s flightless green parrot. It''s kind of like a large fat parrot that lives on the ground. Todd: Really. Rachel: It''s extremely rare. I''m not sure what the numbers are now, but around twenty years ago I think there were only 45 left Todd: Oh, that is rare. Rachel: Extremely rare, so there''s an intensive breeding program for them, and of course nobody''s seen those in the wild. Todd: Yeah, you have to be careful or it''ll go like the way of the Tasmanian tiger. Rachel: Yeah, they breed and they nest on the ground. They lay their eggs on the ground, so they''re very vulnerable to introduced predators, to any animals. Todd: Yeah, I know that, you don''t have snakes, but I know that snakes when they got into Guam they like decimated the bird population. Rachel: Yep. That''s what would happen and that''s why New Zealand immigration customs is very strict about what kind of animals you can bring in. We don''t even have snakes in zoos. Todd: That''s smart. Rachel: Michael Jackson famously came to New Zealand in the 1980''s and wanted to bring his pet snake with him and he wasn''t allowed to. Todd: Oh, good on you. Rachel: There were no exceptions to that rule. Todd: Are there any other birds that don''t fly? For example do you have penguins? Rachel: Oh, yes, there''s lots of penguins in New Zealand. Todd: In the south right? Rachel: Yeah, in the south. Oh, they come up to the north sometimes. Todd: Really, that far north? Rachel: Yeah, occasionally. The big colonies are down south. Todd: Ah, that''s amazing. How cool. Any other birds that don''t fly? Rachel: Not that I can think of off the top of my head. I''d have to look it up on the Internet. Todd: No, that''s still though ... that''s quite a few. That''s so nice. Rachel: The most famous was the moa of course. Todd: The moa? Rachel: Which is an ostrich sized bird. Todd: Oh, really. Rachel: Yeah, but they were ... they were killed off before Europeans arrived in New Zealand. Todd: Oh, easy hunting. Rachel: They were easy hunting. Yeah. And a big feast. Todd: It''s funny how when you go to a place, you really want to see like a local animal, so last year I went to the Middle East. I went to U.A.E and Oman, and I just wanted to see a camel. I wanted to see a camel so bad, and I thought like I''d go down the road.. Rachel: Everyone drives a Mercedes these days. Todd: and there''d be a camel, and I was kind of going out in the countryside. I wasn''t just in the city, and I never saw a camel, and I was asking people that work there, and they''re like, "yeah, you do see them" but I was just so heartbroken that I never saw a camel. Rachel: Ooh! Todd: It''s one of my favorite animals. I just think they look so cool, so when I go to New Zealand, I have to make sure I see a kiwi. Rachel: But you''ll have to go to the kiwi house. Todd: The Kiwi House. Rachel: The Kiwi House it''s called. Or just look up zoos. Todd: And they got ''em? Rachel: Yep, they got ''em there.

I''ve noticed recently in the U.K. that this holiday called Black Friday has appeared, and this is a new thing for us. I don''t really know why it has appeared. I think it is American. Shops just give super discounts in November and people are going crazy for like TVs and stuff. Do you have experience with this? Todd: Yeah, unfortunately, I think it is one of our worst exports. Like I am not a fan of Black Friday. We''ve had it now probably for like ten or twenty years. I can''t remember but it started where the department stores would have these massive sales on Friday which is the day after Thanksgiving, which is always on a Thursday in November. Aimee: Ah, that''s the connection. OK, after Thanksgiving. Todd: Right, and I think it was called Black Friday because that was the day that the stores could show that they had a profit for the year, or something like that. Aimee: OK, so it''s blatantly all about money? Todd: Oh, totally and originally, what they would do is they would entice people with really good bargains, but then they kept ratcheting up the bargain, so now they have these really, really low teaser products, like they only offer ten TVs or something like that for like twenty bucks. Aimee: Oh, so it''s like a limited, a really limited supply of really good deals? Todd: Yeah, and so then what you do is you get these huge crowds that converge on these stores, and then they open the doors and people rush in and literally it''s a free-for-all. You have fights and it''s so crazy. Aimee: I''ve seen that. I''ve seen videos and clips, and it started happening in the U.K. now Todd: Oh, no! Aimee: And I can''t believe it that people can be so greedy. Todd: And especially what''s bothersome is that you''re with your family on a holiday. You''re having a good time, and then you go to war practically. You know what I mean? Aimee: Yeah, with strangers Todd: Yeah. Aimee: Or your neighbor even. It doesn''t matter who it is, just fighting over a cheap TV. Todd: I mean, I''m proud to say I''ve never been to a Black Friday. Aimee: Me neither. Me neither. Todd: So I guess that''s hypocritical for me to say that because you know, since I''ve never been to a Black Friday. I''ve only seen it, but I just don''t like going to shopping malls and to, like, department stores very much - big box stores. I''m just not a shopper. Aimee: So you prefer online shopping? Todd: I just prefer not shopping at all. Like I don''t care like what I dress or how I dress. So, like, I buy my clothes at a supermarket. You know. I know, I''m not the most fashionable person, but as for Black Friday, you know, I think a lot of times, parents what to get stuff for their kids, you know, they want to get that special gift. Maybe I think that''s what attracts a lot of the crowds. Aimee: Yeah, it is, you know, once Thanksgiving is over then it''s the build-up to Christmas, so of course there''s the stress of preparing everything in time for that. It''s hard to resist really good bargains, I guess if you''re trying to be careful with your money. You''re trying to be sensible or there''s those gifts that, you know your child really wants, so I can understand people feel a lot of pressure to do that. Todd: I mean, some of the stores, look like they''ve been through a hurricane after the crowds go through it. It''s crazy. Aimee: It does sound awful. Doesn''t sound like my idea of a good time. Todd: No. Now there is one option though if you don''t want to face the crowds and all the hysteria, you can do what''s called Cyber Monday. Aimee: OK. Todd: Do you have Cyber Monday? Aimee: No, I''m not familiar with it. Todd: So Cyber Monday - I think it''s the Monday after Black Friday - and you just get all the deals online over a 24 hour period. Aimee: OK, is like this remainder, leftover stock? Or is this like a new ...? Todd: No, this is just the online stuff, so I think it''s just, you know, the Amazons and all the online stores, that they want to have their deals that people can buy. Aimee: They wanted a piece of the action, basically. Todd: Yeah, yeah. Exactly so they can make it super, super ... Aimee: It''s too much! Todd: Yeah. Aimee: It is all too much. Todd: I know, we should have like a, you know, I don''t know, a cut back on spending. But if you cut back on spending, then you''re hurting the economy, right, so ... Aimee: I know. It''s true.

What were some things that they do differently, like for example food or games or traditions? Abidemi: Food was a big thing that was different there. They eat a lot of meat, I could say, if I can say that from the sea, so because they''re surrounded by the sea, they have access to a lot of food from there. They eat beluga, seal, whales. Anything that''s found in the sea I think they basically eat it, and they eat just about all the parts of the animal, so that was quite interesting. Todd: That''s so interesting. What does it taste like, seal and whale? Abidemi: Very ...? Todd: Is it cooked? Abidemi: Sometimes they cook it, yeah. They also freeze it. They have different ways of preparing it. Sometimes to do eat it raw. They say that is the best way to eat it to get the most amount of energy from it, and sometimes they freeze it, and they eat it frozen. They eat a lot of fish, frozen fish like that. Attic char - delicious, and sometimes they boil it, but I don''t think that''s their preferred method of eating it. One thing to note is that the younger generation, they seem to prefer more the meat - beef - and the meat that more of everybody eats now, whereas the older generation, of course, they still prefer their traditional way of cooking and eating. Also, they eat caribou, like land animals, caribou, rabbit and one or two other animals that I can''t remember. Todd: Now did you try all these foods? Abidemi: I tried as many as I could. I love eating, and if everyone else is eating it, I''ll eat it too, so I try them all. I have my, the ones I like more, but I didn''t find anything disgusting. I enjoyed it. Todd: That''s so cool. Did you learn how to prepare it or cook some of it? Abidemi: No. I''m laughing because I''m not a huge cook anywhere, so I just do the eating and cleaning up. Todd: Yeah, OK cool. You mentioned that they played some games. They have their own style of games. Do you remember any games that they play? Abidemi: They have games, where one was like wrestling. They have a lot of body contact games where they would wrestle on the ground, or you had to hold up your leg a certain way for how many minutes, just really games that had to deal with strength and endurance is what I would say, and then they played a lot of games using dice where you would win prizes. I think a lot of these things were designed for the long winter months, so they could stay indoors and still keep themselves entertained, and because in those days, in the past they didn''t have TV or have the kind of entertainment, Internet, which they do have there now, so they have a lot of games that they still try to play sometimes to keep them entertained. And music is a large part of their life too. A lot of people play different instruments and they square dance. They''re really good dancers. They can dance all night, so that was fun as well. Todd: Oh wow, sounds like a great place. Abidemi: Yes, it was. Todd: So do they have their own type of instruments? Their own traditional instruments? Abidemi: I would say no. The instruments that I saw were more things that had been brought up to them, for example the fiddle, guitar, stuff like that. Thinking back on it now, maybe there were one or two things that they had made, but I didn''t feel like, I can''t really remember the name. I didn''t really remember the names, so.

Tony: Yeah. But actually my passion is airport to airport, what happens between airports. Steph: So you like the flying then, the journey? Tony: Absolutely. Steph: What about that do you like? Tony: I love airplanes. Do I love airports? Not really. When I go to an airport I go to the window to look at the airplanes. Since the tender age of five I''ve always had this passion for airplanes, and my dream was to become an airline pilot. Steph: Okay. Have you ever flown an airplane? Tony: Have I ever flown in an airplane? Steph: Not in an airplane. Have you ever flown an airplane? Tony: I''ve never flown an airplane. I''ve been in the flight deck of a number of aircraft, but I''ve never flown one. Steph: Okay. So walk us through a trip with Tony. What''s going through your mind along the journey from airport to airport? Tony: Well, just like the other souls on board, I go on, I sit, I buckle my seatbelt. I obey the commands from the cabin crew. I hear the pilots talking over the Intercom. But I take it another step further. I actually listen to the details of what the pilots are saying. I''m thinking about what''s the weather going to be like, what''s the weather on the ground, what''s the surface winds on the runway? All these things that regular passengers don''t think about when they''re sitting in the seat and they''re just like. Steph: Yeah. I certainly don''t think about that, no. I am probably just relaxing, and maybe once in a while looking out the window, if I''m privileged enough to get a window seat. And just seeing how pretty it is. Tony: And if you''re looking out, and you say you have a seat just over the wing, you''re looking out and you''re like, oh, there''s the wing. It looks nice, long, okay. Steph: I don''t even think that much at any rate. Tony: Yeah. Yeah. But to me, I''m looking at the wing and I''m like, that''s the forward slats, those are the landing flaps, that''s the spoiler. Oh, look at the winglet at the end. Yeah. Steph: Okay. No, I''m definitely not thinking that at all. So you actually don''t care about the cities that you''re traveling to, and seeing new places? Tony: No, no, no. Don''t get me wrong. I actually do. I''ve had the fortune of visiting some really amazing places, like Glasgow, Scotland, which I do love. Meeting the people, meeting different people actually is something I look forward to. And the architecture and all the fun stuff, like art, artworks and crafts and all that stuff that when you travel you always try to secure before you return home. But yeah, I do, I do like the experiences outside of aviation when it comes to traveling. But for me, you may think it''s weird, but it''s still aviation for me. That''s the top. That''s definitely at the top of the list for me. When it comes to flight there are five critical phases. You have takeoff, climb out, cruise, descent and landing. Even at the end of a flight, coming to the end just before landing, the pilots are trying their best to keep the nose of the airplane training down the center line of the runway. After landing, when we''re deplaning, I would often stop at the flight deck door and I''ll be like, "What happened there just before touchdown?" And the pilots would laugh and be like, "Oh, just a little gust. Nothing really. But we''re on the ground, we''re safe." Steph: Oh my gosh. So basically you''re grading the pilot as you are taking a trip somewhere. Tony: Weird. It''s so weird, right? Steph: Absolutely. Absolutely weird. Tony: That''s what aviation buffs do. Steph: Crazy.

What do you think are the most important things that I should do to have good physical health? Christian: That''s a great question. I think it''s a combination of things. You need to make sure that you''re eating healthily. That means lots of fruits and vegetables, no junk food like fried food, and no sugary foods like cookies and chocolates. You can treat yourself here and there of course, but don''t make it part of your routine. And I also think that exercising is very, very important. Tahia: How do you exercise and how often do you exercise? Christian: I exercise by going to the gym, which is where I run on the treadmill and lift weights to tone and grow my muscles, which is super important to me. Usually I work out for around one hour each time and try to go at least five times a week. How about you? What''s your favorite way to exercise? Tahia: I do like going to the gym, but I enjoy it best when I mix it with going to classes like Zumba and Pilates classes. It''s a great mix and it means that I don''t get bored. Another thing that I''m trying to do as well as exercising is drinking way more water. It helps to keep you more energetic, helps your skin be clearer, and generally helps your health in a lot of ways. How much water do you drink in a day? Christian: Let me think. Usually I aim for two and a half liters of water a day, and I like adding lemons and strawberries to my water to make drinking more exciting. Because, you know, drinking only water every day can get a little bit boring. One thing that I''m working on right now is having a very healthy sleep routine. Right now, I''m only sleeping for around four hours a night and it''s been making me feel very tired throughout the day. What about you? How many hours do you sleep? Tahia: I try to sleep for about eight hours, but sometimes it''s longer and sometimes it''s shorter. The key is to sleep at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning so that you can build a routine. But you brought up an interesting point about feeling tired throughout the day. That''s definitely something that I''m struggling with. I feel like my energy levels are low all the time and I''m not sure what to do to help boost my energy. Do you have any tips for that? Christian: Yeah. Do you drink coffee in the morning? Tahia: I do. Actually, I think I drink about three cups of coffee a day. Christian: Wow. That''s a lot, but I do know some people that can drink up to seven cups of coffee a day. So I don''t know what to tell you. I don''t know if it''s a good or a bad thing that you drink so much coffee, but maybe you should try not drinking coffee for a week and see if your energy levels improve. Do you think that''s something that you could do? Tahia: I did read in a study once that drinking coffee gives you a lot of caffeine, which can make you feel like you have a lot of energy at the time, but really interrupts with your sleep schedule. So for example, if you drink coffee at 6:00 PM, you''ll struggle to sleep. And maybe that''s the reason why you don''t actually get enough sleep. Do you drink a lot of coffee too? Christian: Yeah. Not too much. Sometimes I''ll drink one cup on another day, I''ll drink two cups. Sometimes I can even drink five cups if I have a lot of things to do that day. But my energy levels don''t change too much when I drink coffee. I think I''m just so used to it now that it just doesn''t impact me that much, which is probably not a good thing. What do you think? Tahia: I don''t think that''s a good thing at all. I think as well as coffee, energy drinks is a problem. Yeah, sure, you might get energy in the moment, but it can really affect the quality of your sleep, not just the quantity. So that''s definitely something that I think you should work on. Christian: Yeah.

And I''ve just been wondering, what is mental health? Could you please explain it to me? Tahia: Sure. So in a nutshell, mental health is about the day-in, day-out state of our emotional, psychological and social wellbeing. But unfortunately, we tend to neglect our mental health and brush it aside until it snowballs into a more serious problem and even a mental health disorder in some cases. Christian: Wow. Okay. Could you please explain what is a mental health disorder, and what kind of different mental health disorders are there? Tahia: So, everybody experiences mental health issues, but for some people, they might have a mental health disorder genetically, or for some people, they might develop mental health disorders over time. So there are about five categories of mental health disorders, I would say. The first one is mood disorders like depression and bipolar, where you can be really happy one moment and extremely sad the next, and this can actually start interrupting your day to day life and your ability to complete simple tasks. There''s also psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, where you can hallucinate. There''s body disorders like anorexia and body dysmorphia, which affects the way that you look at yourself physically and ultimately affects how you psychologically perceive yourself. There are also cognitive disorders, which are issues relating to learning difficulties, Alzheimer''s and things like this. And then the final, perhaps most common area of mental health disorders is anxiety, which includes things like social anxiety and OCD, which stands for obsessive compulsive disorder. So this could be for example, obsessively cleaning, because you feel as though if you don''t clean, you''re being lazy or you feel like you can''t be productive. So that''s kind of the five different categories of mental health disorders that I think are out there at the moment. Christian: Wow. That''s very interesting. And I do think that I have social anxiety because whenever I go out, I tend to get very nervous and sweaty. So for someone like me and for other people that may have other mental health disorders, what can we do to improve our mental health? Tahia: Well, depending on what you think you''re struggling with, there are loads of different techniques and specific things that you can do to tackle them. So, for example, have you seen fidget toys recently on social media? Christian: Yeah, I have. Tahia: So, fidget toys are a really good way to just manage your anxiety. So, for example, my little sister loves using fidget toys when she''s speaking or when she''s thinking about something that''s making her feel stressed out. It''s just a way of physically releasing some of the energy that you have built up inside of you because of your anxiety. Christian: Wow. That''s amazing. I think I''m going to have to buy one. Tahia: Definitely. I would recommend it. But apart from more specific things that you can do, I have some general advice. I think that we really have to take care of our physical health, meaning exercising and eating and drinking the right foods and lots of water. We also have to make sure that we''re spending time with our friends and families and then we take time for ourselves. I personally love meditating as this is me time. And I also like doing self care activities like putting on a mask and going to the salon to look and feel good. I would really recommend that you spend a lot of me time and do have a self-care activity that you care about. What activity would you do? Christian: I think I would do meditating, but I''m not too sure how to do it. Could you please explain to me how I could meditate? Tahia: Sure. There are loads of useful apps that you could use that gives you tips and techniques on how to meditate. One that I use is Balance, and it teaches me how to use breathing techniques to manage my stress. For example, by breathing in for four seconds, holding my breath for seven seconds and breathing out for eight seconds, which is called the 4-7-8 technique. You should definitely try that. Christian: Amazing. I will definitely try that.

Now you''ve invested in bitcoin before? Anthony: Yeah, yeah, a bit. Todd: Do you still invest a lot now? Anthony: I haven''t recently. Todd: Okay, so why did you stop? Anthony: I stopped because I was getting a little anxious about seeing my portfolio swing up and down by 5, 6, 7 thousand dollars in a day. I kind of decided that I would take out the money that I invested in it and just let my profits ride, basically. Todd: Right, so basically originally then, you were using bitcoin for speculative purposes. Not to actually buy things. You weren''t using it as a means to actually make transactions. Anthony: That is correct. I''ve only bought one thing with bitcoin, and that was, it''s called a hardware wallet, which is basically, it looks like a USB stick, but it''s a way to secure your funds. Todd: Do you think that in the future we will have people using bitcoins more, like it''s going to become a viable alternative to actually, for commerce to pay for things? Anthony: Yeah, that''s a good question. I don''t think bitcoin will be what we all use, but it''s definitely, in my opinion, it''s definitely the archetype for what is coming. Todd: It''s the pioneer. Anthony: Yes, the pioneering technology. There''s going to be something that is similar to bitcoin that we use as a digital payment system. Todd: Yeah, so a lot of people are freaked out about bitcoin. What are some reasons people are skeptical against it? Anthony: That''s a good question. One question that I''ve been asked before is, who controls it? Everyone always wants to know who''s in charge. Right. Who''s the CEO? Right? Because we''re so conditioned to this kind of system, but that is the thing. It''s kind of scary for some people, but there is no control over it. It''s a program at the end of the day. And there''s no governing body. There''s no government organization that really has a say. I mean governments, specific governments, will try to regulate the markets to a certain extent. But at the end of the day, the power is in the hands of the people that use it, really. And as long as people use it there will be some kind of value to it. Just as long as we use paper money, there''s value to it. As long as it''s exchanged, right? Todd: Right. And some people have made some good points. For example, nobody foresaw the use of ecommerce or smart phones, or social media. But these things adopted and ramped up quickly. So, do you think this could happen with these crypto technologies? Anthony: I think- Todd: Is that the right way to say it? Crypto technologies. Anthony: Cryptocurrencies. Todd: Cryptocurrencies. Anthony: Or block chain technologies. Todd: Block chain technology, okay. Anthony: I think it''s very rapid right now. It''s kind of becoming a household word. Whereas, when I first got into it, if I talked to someone about bitcoin, they would look at me like I was crazy. They would look at me like I had a hole in my face or something. But now people know. Even older people who aren''t really so in touch with technology, know what it is or have at least heard about it. butI I think the biggest hurdle to mass adoptions is as it stands now, it takes a lot of knowledge and a lot of know-how in order to safely, because the reason why I say safely, is because if you''re dealing with bitcoin, you''re in charge of securing your funds. So, if someone hacks into your funds, or something, then it''s your fault. You don''t have anyone to blame. Where as if you have your money in a bank- Todd: You can''t call customer service. Anthony: Exactly. You can''t call customer service, so there''s a big hurdle as far as the knowledge you need to safely and effectively maneuver in that space. So I think until some second party or third party comes about and makes it more user-friendly, I don''t really think it''s going to be ready to really take over until that happens., because either more people need to be educated and know how to use it and how to purchase it and how to store it, etc. Or there needs to be some huge company that going to say, "Look, we''ll manage it for you. You just need this app, or something." I don''t know, something like that. Todd: Yeah, it''s going to be interesting in the crossover. They always say be careful what you wish for, you might just get it. If bitcoin or some crypto- Anthony: Currency Todd: Currency becomes the primary source of transactions, I think a lot of the ills and the dodgy stuff we have with banks, will seep into it. It''ll be interesting if they could keep it out. If you know what I mean. But one thing that''s interesting about the currencies is that, I think a lot of old people will go for it. I think a lot of old people usually are hesitant about technology and change, but the thing, they have a lot of money that they''re sitting on, usually, older people., and they also don''t trust the government. They''ve been around a long time and so I think these cryptocurrencies are going to be very attractive to a lot of tech un-savvy people. What do you think about that? Anthony: I think you have a point. I think that probably more so than young people have money to invest, but I think that''s, like I said before, I''ve spent so many hours reading about these kinds of technologies and just really obsessing over it, and I still feel like there''s so much I don''t know. So. Todd: Well, I guess we all got to learn. Anthony: Yeah.

For example, I''ve heard you guys don''t have homework, don''t have standardized tests. Tell me a little bit more about how school is in Norway. Gyri: Yeah. So, we don''t have a lot of homework, that''s true. When I was little, or in grade school, we had homework, but not too much. I think they changed it recently so that they almost have no homework anymore. Viyasan: Okay. Gyri: Also, in junior high I remember that we did have homework, but it was like, it didn''t really matter if you did it or not. So it was, how I remember grade school and junior high is that it''s pretty relaxed. Viyasan: So that''s very interesting, because I''m sure all around the world students who go to school have lots of homework, they have lots of classes to take, they''re probably in classes for lots of hours in a day. That''s pretty cool, like, do you think it''s working? What are your thoughts on it? Gyri: Well, I think Norway really wants to focus on that if we have a lot of free time then we learn better, like we''ll stay motivated instead of like having to go to school and then also having to work with school when you get home. Like you should ... Norwegians, I think, mostly agree that you do school at school, and then you do other things after so you don''t have to think about school all the time. Viyasan: So there''s a large emphasis on what you do outside of the classroom. Gyri: Yeah. Viyasan: Got it, okay. Gyri: Yeah, ''cause I think one of the problems that we have in Norway is like motivation, maybe because, like, we''re a more relaxed, or we''re, yeah, we''re more relaxed when it comes to education, other problems show up. So we have a lot of, yeah, we have a problem with pupils that can''t focus. Viyasan: Got it. Gyri: And we''re also, we don''t have enough teachers as well. So that''s a problem now in Norway, that not enough people are getting their, or becoming teachers, and there are so many students that have other needs than the rest of the students and we don''t have enough teachers to follow up on all of them. So that''s Norway''s focus now, I think. Viyasan: Got it. Gyri: To get more teachers, and have like, I think the goal is to have one teacher for every five kids. Viyasan: Wow. Gyri: Yeah. Viyasan: That''s intense. Wow. Gyri: Yeah. So everyone gets the, gets a lot of- Viyasan: To compare and contrast with Canada at least, and Toronto, in high school there is about one student, or sorry, one teacher per 28 students. Gyri: Oh, wow. Viyasan: Students. Gyri: Yeah. Viyasan: So it''s very tough for the teacher to learn all the names, especially in the first few months, and they have to keep on doing that year, after year, after year, and every year usually it increases. So 28 turns into 30, 30 turns into 33, and so, wow, that''s quite intense to see the differences. But how do you think the students are liking that approach of one teacher and five students? Do they like how that style of class is? Gyri: I think so, because especially for some students that don''t take, that don''t learn as fast, they have a teacher that can help them to, yeah, and that helps their specific needs, because if you only have one teacher in like a big classroom, then the really, the kids that learn fast, they''ll take everything on their own, and then you''ll have like this, these bunch of kids that are lost. So I think people are pretty happy with this. Viyasan: Got it. Gyri: But it''s not like ... This is the goal. I think right now maybe we maybe have a teacher for every 10 pupils or something. Viyasan: And so, for example, there''s different ways for teachers to grade a student or a certain class. Of course, there''s the pass or fail, very binary, you either pass the class or you fail the class, there''s percentages, so you can do very well or very poor in the class, there''s the bell curve, of course, and I think the last one would be, yeah, portfolio based, so that''s based off of different tasks and the teacher leaves a comment of how you did and ways to improve. Which ways do you think would be best for students to learn and how do they do it in Norway? Gyri: Well, in Norway I think they do a combination of all of them, but we definitely do a lot of the latter, the portfolio based, so you don''t necessarily get a grade, but you get feedback, detailed feedback on how you did and what you need to improve. And I think that''s my, I prefer that method, because it''s not as, like it focuses on the learning, not on the grade. Viyasan: Got it. Gyri: And I think that''s important, but grades are useful as well. Especially if you''re a competitive student, I think grades are very useful. But yeah, so I think the best way to do it is to have a combination of the different types of grading systems. What about you? Viyasan: Yeah, I agree. In Canada, well at least in Toronto, what they do is they do a mix of both the bell curve and the percentage, and so usually depending on how your class performs, for example if you''re in a statistics class filled with 50 students and the average that everyone gets on a certain test is 40% out of 100%, and that usually is the case because of how difficult the class is, there usually is a bell curve so that they meet a minimum of maybe 60%, so that way students that got a 70 on it get a 90 in the class. That''s some ways that teachers grade university level classes, but of course in high school usually you''re given a letter grade. For example, A plus is perfect, about 90%, and then A, A minus, B, B plus, that kind of stuff, or percentages as well. And so, I think they''re both very cool to compare and contrast, but I definitely do like how Norway provides comments and detailed feedback, so it''s not just “Yes, you got that right,” and “No, you got that wrong,” it''s “This is what you did very well,” and “You can perform even better on those areas by following some of these steps.” I think that''s very beneficial, especially for young students trying to grasp a concept, and really master a certain area and find out what they like.

So, you''ve talked a lot about things we should do, but what about stopping doing things or breaking bad habits? Like that''s the hardest thing, right? What''s your advice for giving up sugar or alcohol or obsessive behavior, things like that? Olga: Well, actually, I am not suggesting that people fight with themselves, and they avoid or break anything, because that would constitute violence against yourself. I am a student of Marshall Rosenberg, who developed a nonviolent communication system, so instead of taking away the bad, you add something good, so you find exciting, fun, new habits that will naturally substitute. Todd: Okay, so for example, let''s say you watch too much TV, or you''re addicted to your smartphone, you would try to maybe play outside or do something like that? Olga: Well, you can develop a lot of new habits and see what works for you. One of the things that I discovered for myself is that willpower is a very finite resource. We don''t have infinite amounts of willpower, so we need to use it very sparingly on short distances. It''s not for marathons, so what I suggest, when you''re establishing a new habit that you feel that is the right habit for you, you need to use a little bit of willpower to repeat it enough times. Usually magic number is 21 days. Todd: Really? 21 days, why 21? Olga: I have no idea, but this number keeps popping up from different traditions in East and West and also psychology, and I saw it in my own practice that it works. Todd: Fascinating, so what about, like, let''s say you want to give up sugar, or you want to give up smoking or something like that, you know a physical substance? Do you have any tips for that? Olga: Yes. One of their easiest things to do is incorporate fermented foods that break up biochemical dependency on sugars, alcohol, and some other addictive substances, so when I work with people who are recovering from any kind of addictions, they don''t have to be substance addictions, fermented foods help a lot. Todd: Okay. Can you give some examples of fermented foods? Olga: Absolutely. If you just chop up any kind of vegetable, let''s say it''s cabbage and carrot, so you cut it up. You massage it with salt and some spices until their juice comes out. You press it down so all the vegetables are covered with its own juice. Three days later, you have perfect fermented sauerkraut. Todd: Wow, that''s great. So, could you just buy sauerkraut or vinegar or something like that? Like, would that work? Olga: Well, unfortunately, it wouldn''t, because most of their krauts that you buy is pasteurized, which does not give you their pro-biotic activity. A lot of it is fake sauerkraut. What I mean by that, if there was no bacterial activity and their taste comes from vinegar, you do not get this benefit. Todd: Wow, that''s good to know. I think though part of the problem though is even myself thinking like, "Oh, I''m not going to cut up a bunch of cabbage and carrots, and wait three days." Like, it seems like it''s too much work. Olga: Well, it might be, and you know, maybe you can visit a friend who is doing that, or if you have access to farmer''s market or some natural organic stores, they may provide something that is not pasteurized and prepared the right way. Todd: Oh, that''s a good idea. Okay, well, thanks a lot. That was some really good advice.

Viyasan: There''s lots of different types of skills out there that have my attention but I think the most important skill or the most useful skill for me would be to clone myself. There''s an anime, Naruto, and coincidentally we''re in Japan as well. In Naruto, you''re able to clone yourself and when you clone yourself you''re able to still retain all the knowledge that your clone is doing. For example, I could be here doing an interview and my clone could be outside swimming and practicing swimming, and then when my clone disappears, I''ll still retain all the knowledge I have from swimming even though I was performing an interview here. I think that would be very useful in learning a lot of different types of things. For example, languages, practicing sports, cooking food, and it would be very efficient with my time and I''d be able to complete everything on my schedule. Gyri: Multi-tasking. Viyasan: Exactly. Multi-tasking at its finest. That''s definitely a superhero power that I would love to have. Gyri: Mm-hmm. Viyasan: What about yourself? What would you like to do? Gyri: Oh, I''m not sure. When I was little I always wanted to be able to fly or breathe underwater because I really wanted to be a mermaid when I was little, but I think now maybe just teleportation would be really nice. I wouldn''t have to walk everywhere. I''m a little lazy. I wouldn''t have to sit on the plane for like ten hours when I visit my family in the states. I hate flying, it''s just really boring. Viyasan: Yeah. Gyri: So yeah, definitely teleportation, I think. Viyasan: Okay, that''s a very interesting superhero ability to have. Gyri: Yeah. Viyasan: Definitely makes life a lot quicker. You won''t have to sit in rush hour either when you''re driving home from work. Gyri: Yeah, and I could just teleport to all the different places and countries that I wanted to go to. Viyasan: Exactly. Gyri: Yeah. Viyasan: That''d be amazing as well, yeah. What else? What other types of superhero powers would you have besides teleportation? Gyri: Maybe superhuman strength. Viyasan: Mm-hmm. Gyri: That would be cool, I think. Just walking around lifting people up and stuff. Viyasan: Yeah. Gyri: Or lifting up buildings, like Superman. Viyasan: Yeah, like Superman. Gyri: Stopping asteroids and yeah. But people would definitely notice that I had super powers and maybe that''s not a good idea. Viyasan: You might want to compete in some strong man or power building competitions. Gyri: Yeah, yeah. Viyasan: Super lifting, yeah. Gyri: I would become famous. Viyasan: Exactly, yeah. That would be a good career move, eh? Gyri: Yeah, but it would be purely talent and not hard work. Viyasan: Exactly, exactly. But I guess you''d have to practice your superhero strength. Gyri: I guess. Viyasan: By picking up different things. Gyri: Yeah, and practicing not using too much strength and crushing things. Viyasan: That''s true. That''s true, yeah. That''s very cool. Gyri: Are there any other powers that you would like to have? Viyasan: The one superhero that''s my favorite is Spider-Man and so I saw all of his movies as a little kid and so I think having webs coming out of your wrist, being able to fly between skyscrapers, being able to stick people onto walls, fighting crime. That would be really cool, but just mainly for the amusement aspect of flying around, sling shooting different things with your webs. That would be very cool and a very unique skill to have. Gyri: Yeah. Viyasan: That super power would be amazing to have, yeah. Gyri: Mm-hmm . He''s your favorite superhero? Viyasan: Yeah, I would say that he''s the superhero that I relate to the most. Just recently Spider-Man High School came out and so it depicted Peter Parker, Spider-Man, in high school and so it was a very fun movie and definitely relates a lot to high school and it was very fun to watch and I really enjoyed that. Definitely Spider-Man is my favorite superhero and I really enjoyed his movie and definitely would love to have his web shooting abilities. Gyri: Mm-hmm .

And he’s talking about slow travel, which is the concept of living in a foreign country for a long time to experience the culture and the lifestyle. Dan, can you talk a little bit about the cost, like if somebody wants to really do this, how much money do they need for housing, transportation, food, things like that? Dan: Well, when I quit my job four years ago, I had a mantra in my head. And I always said, all I need to be happy in life is a thousand bucks and a backpack. And I thought, if I could really simplify my life and take away all the overhead cost of car payment or a mortgage on a house or student load debts, credit cards, things like that, all I would need is a thousand dollars of income a month in order to own my time and to spend my time going to anywhere I wanted. I think realistically in places in Southeast Asia, if you want to move around every two or three months or go visit friends at another city, you''re going to want at least $1,500 to $2,000 a month. And that’s going to give you, I would say, a quite luxurious lifestyle. Obviously, you could come here to Bali and live for $700 a month and you could do the same in Nha Trang like we’re talking earlier, maybe even easier in Vietnam. But the real cost come in is when you want to explore and move around internationally. So if you’re living in Nha Trang and you’d like to visit a friend in Bangkok every three months or something like that, you’re going to want more like 1,500 to 2,000 a month. Todd: So could you like break down the cost? So what kind of cost are we talking here? Like how much would you pay for housing? How much would you pay, you know, for food every month? How much would you pay for health insurance? Things like that. Dan: Sure, I mean, if we can make like a vast generalization across Southeast Asia in general. I know it’s a huge place but in most places for a furnished apartment, for a solo traveler, you’re going to look at anywhere from $250 to $750 a month. So let’s just ballpark it and say $500. You know, in a place like Manila, you’re going to get a great apartment for $500. In a place like Bangkok, you’re going to get even better apartment for $500. And again, you have to commit to a month at least to get these kinds of rates. But if you’re willing to do that, stay for few months, you’re going to get really good advantage there. Let’s take Bangkok as an example. $500, you’re going to have a great apartment. For another $500, you are going to eat like King Midas. And then let’s say your internet is $30 a month and your health insurance in $120 a month. We’re at about $1,200 a month now. And I’d say, on top of that, it''s all about the most dangerous habit for your wallet on the planet, and it is travel. So if you decide that you want to go home for Christmas and you want to go home for Thanksgiving as well for Americans, you know, that’s going to kill your piggy bank. But if you don’t travel so much, you could easily stay in a place like Bangkok for $1,000 to $1,500 a month. Todd: So, what about like a, you know, going out having beers and thinks like that? Like are there certain habits that you have to kind of curtail or keep down so that you save money? Dan: Well, it really depends where you live. So, in the Philippines you could go out and party every night and it won’t make a dent in your wallet. Whereas in places like here in Bali, you had to be really careful because beers can be $7 for one cocktail. So if you go out to the club and you order 4 cocktails, and you meet a cute girl and you buy her 2 cocktails, that could easily turn into a $50 evening, and that’s going to kill your traveler’s budget. So generally in Southeast Asia going out for social drinks isn’t a big impact on your wallet because booze here is relatively cheap. But definitely that can have a big impact.

Do you feel it in your heart? Todd: Wow, that''s pretty good. So also you could probably use your heart to see if it''s true, right? Like intuition. Is it something that''s believable? If it''s something that''s true? Olga: Exactly. You know, you can call it a gut feeling, intuition, talking to angels. I teach bio-resonance, based on that it''s how to raise your intuition to pretty much the brain level and understand yourself, but it''s not ... Gut feeling is not an H, so I just stick with heart. Todd: I like that. Okay, so then after the heart you said it''s hand? Olga: Yes. The third level of learning is experiencing it, so using your hands and bringing all this knowledge into your life and seeing how it works. Todd: Alright, so basically like put something into practice, right? Use it or lose it. If you don''t do it, then you''re not going to really know it. Olga: Exactly. Lose it and use it work on all levels. Is there muscles if you don''t lose goes into atrophy, same goes for your memory or anything else in your life. Todd: Oh wow, that''s great. Okay, so then the last one is help? Olga: Yes, so once you understand what to do, you feel that it''s the right thing to do, you experience and you saw the positive results, then it''s only natural to share your success story and help other people. For me, the best way to learn is by teaching, by helping. Todd: Oh wow, that''s really nice. So recap, so it''s head, you take in the information; heart, you know if it''s true or not, like does it resonate with you? Hand, you put it into practice; and then help, you actually give. Olga: Yes, exactly. Todd: Wow, that''s some really good advice. Thanks a lot.

Yeah, yeah, so and I think the winters are probably quite mild, unless you’re from the North of Italy of course, near the mountains. Aimee: Yeah. Paul: Down in the south it remains kind of pretty mild, you know? Aimee: Aha, if it’s in the Med ... It''s my images of that. I’ve never been to Italy so I don’t know.
